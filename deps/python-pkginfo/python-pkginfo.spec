%description
This package provides an API for querying the distutils metadata written in the
PKG-INFO file inside a source distribution (an sdist) or a binary distribution
(e.g., created by running bdist_egg). It can also query the EGG-INFO directory
of an installed distribution, and the *.egg-info stored in a "development
checkout" (e.g, created by running setup.py develop).
