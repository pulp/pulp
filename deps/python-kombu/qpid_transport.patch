+class Channel(base.StdChannel):
+    """Supports broker configuration and messaging send and receive.
+
+    A Channel object is designed to have method-parity with a Channel as
+    defined in AMQP 0-10 and earlier, which allows for the following broker
+    actions:
+
+        - exchange declare and delete
+        - queue declare and delete
+        - queue bind and unbind operations
+        - queue length and purge operations
+        - sending/receiving/rejecting messages
+        - structuring, encoding, and decoding messages
+        - supports synchronous and asynchronous reads
+        - reading state about the exchange, queues, and bindings
+
+    Channels are designed to all share a single TCP connection with a
+    broker, but provide a level of isolated communication with the broker
+    while benefiting from a shared TCP connection.  The Channel is given
+    its :class:`Connection` object by the :class:`Transport` that
+    instantiates the Channel.
+
+    This Channel inherits from :class:`~kombu.transport.base.StdChannel`,
+    which makes this a 'native' Channel versus a 'virtual' Channel which
+    would inherit from :class:`kombu.transports.virtual`.
+
+    Messages sent using this Channel are assigned a delivery_tag. The
+    delivery_tag is generated for a message as they are prepared for
+    sending by :meth:`basic_publish`.  The delivery_tag is unique per
+    Channel instance using :meth:`~itertools.count`.  The delivery_tag has
+    no meaningful context in other objects, and is only maintained in the
+    memory of this object, and the underlying objects that provide support
+    (ie: :class:`QoS`).
+
+    Each Channel object instantiates exactly one :class:`QoS` object for
+    prefetch limiting, and asynchronous acking. The :class:`QoS` object is
+    lazily instantiated through a property method :meth:`qos`.  The
+    :class:`QoS` object is a supporting object that should not be accessed
+    directly except by the Channel itself.
+
+    Synchronous reads on a queue are done using a call to :meth:`basic_get`
+    which uses :meth:`_get` to perform the reading. These methods read
+    immediately and do not accept any form of timeout. :meth:`basic_get`
+    reads synchronously and ACKs messages before returning them, or acking
+    can be disable by the no_ack argument to :meth:`basic_get`.
+
+    Asynchronous reads on a queue are done by starting a consumer using
+    :meth:`basic_consume`.  Each call to :meth:`basic_consume` will cause a
+    thread to be started where a :class:`~qpid.messaging.endpoints.Receiver`
+    will perform a blocking read on the requested queue. Typically a more
+    efficient external I/O event notification system such as epoll or
+    kqueue would allow the kernel to monitor many file descriptors for
+    inbound data, but the :mod:`qpid.messaging` module does not allow an
+    external epoll or kqueue loop to be used. Consumers are given a
+    consumer tag by the caller of consumer_tag. Already started consumers
+    can be cancelled using by their consumer_tag using :meth:`basic_cancel`.
+
+    The Channel object handles thread creation of :class:`FDShimThread`
+    objects which provide asynchronous blocking reads.  FDShimThreads are
+    given a :class:`Queue.Queue` named delivery_queue to put messages into.
+    delivery_queue is provided by the creator of the Channel (typically a
+    :class:`Transport` object).  Cancellation of a consumer causes the
+    consuming class:`FDShimThread` to be notified it is no longer needed.
+
+    Asynchronous message acking is supported through :meth:`basic_ack`,
+    and is referenced by delivery_tag. The Channel object uses its
+    :class:`QoS` object to perform the message acking.
