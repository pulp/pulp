Celery 3.1.11 requires kombu>=3.0.15,<4.0, which is not in Fedora <= 20, or
EPEL <= 7.

Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport which is available in upstream
kombu>=3.0.24


Permanent Patches:

1212200.patch - This patch will need to continue to be with us forever as it
                works around a permanent downstream issue whereby ordereddict
                is installed as part of the Python system library, and not in
                site-packages. This is not contributed to upstream Kombu.


Temporary Patches:

This are contributed to upstream Kombu and will be included in a future release
of Kombu, but until it is we include it in downstream.

1195361.patch - Fixes close bug where the connection was not being closed. This
                fixes https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues/455

476.patch - Fixes file descriptor leak issue:
            https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues/476


Patches that need to be contributed upstream:

1182322.patch - Fixes an auth mechanism issue. This patch adds an additional
                string that is returned when PLAIN is not available and the
                python-saslwrapper is installed. I don't think an upstream
                issue was filed on this, and I don't think it is in upstream
                yet. It should be contributed upstream.
