Celery 3.1.11 requires kombu>=3.0.15,<4.0, which is not in Fedora <= 20, or EPEL <= 7.

Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport which is available in upstream kombu>=3.0.24


Permanent Patches:

1212200.patch - This patch will need to continue to be with us forever as it works around a
                permanent downstream issue whereby ordereddict is installed as part of the Python
                system library, and not in site-packages. This is not contributed to upstream Kombu.


Temporary Patches:

This are contributed to upstream Kombu and will be included in a future release of Kombu, but until
it is we include it in downstream.

1195361.patch - Fixes close bug where the connection was not being closed. This fixes
                https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues/455


Patches that need to be contributed upstream:

1182322.patch - Fixes an auth mechanism issue. This patch adds an additional string that is
                returned when PLAIN is not available and the python-saslwrapper is installed. I
                don't think an upstream issue was filed on this, and I don't think it is in
                upstream yet. It should be contributed upstream.
