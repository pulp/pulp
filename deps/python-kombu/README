Celery 3.1.11 requires kombu>=3.0.15,<4.0, which is not in Fedora <= 20, or EPEL <= 7.

Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport through a PR celery/kombu#335 that
has been submitted upstream, but not yet merged.  This patch is introduced
through the spec file, and can be removed once:

1.  celery/kombu#335 is merged upstream.
2.  celery/kombu#335 is included in a Kombu release
3.  This dependency is updated to the release containing celery/kombu#335.
