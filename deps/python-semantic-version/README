Team owner: mhrivnak

This is required for pulp-puppet-plugins.

This is not currently in epel <= 7 or fedora <= 20.

There are no known restrictions on what version to use.

The plan is to get this into Fedora and EPEL. mhrivnak got it to build successfully
on the fedora koji and will continue on that path.
