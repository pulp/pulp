# This is an example migration module.
# Each migration module must implement the following members:
# 1. version - integer representing the version the module migrates to
# 2. migrate() - function with no arguments that performs the migration

import logging

_log = logging.getLogger('pulp')


version = 1

def migrate():
    # There's a bit of the chicken and the egg problem here, since versioning
    # wasn't built into pulp from the beginning, we just have to bite the
    # bullet and call some initial state of the data model 'version 1'.
    # So this function is essentially a no-op.
    _log.info('migration to data model version 1 started')
    _log.info('migration to data model version 1 complete')
