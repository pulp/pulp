# This is an example migration module.
# Each migration module must implement the following members:
# 1. version - integer representing the version the module migrates to
# 2. migrate() - function with no arguments that performs the migration

    # There's a bit of the chicken and the egg problem here, since versioning
    # wasn't built into pulp from the beginning, we just have to bite the
    # bullet and call some initial state of the data model 'version 1'.
    # So this function is essentially a no-op.
