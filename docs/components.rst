Architecture and Deploying
==========================

Pulp's architecture has three components to it: a REST API, a content serving application, and the
tasking system. Each component can be horizontally scaled for both high availability and/or
additional capacity for that part of the architecture.

REST API
--------

Pulp's REST API is a Django application which runs under any WSGI server. It serves the following
things:

* The REST API hosted at ``/pulp/api/v3/``
* The browse-able documentation at ``/pulp/api/v3/docs/``
* Any viewsets or views provided by plugins
* Static content used by Django, e.g. images used by the browse-able API. This is not Pulp content.

.. note::

   A simple, but limited way to run the REST API as a standalone service using the built-in Django
   runserver.::

      $ python pulp-manager runserver


The REST API can be deployed with any any WSGI webserver like a normal Django application. See the
`Django deployment docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/howto/deployment/wsgi/>`_ for more
information.

Content Serving Application
---------------------------

An aiohttp.server based application that serves content to clients. The content could be
:term:`Artifacts<artifact>` already downloaded and saved in Pulp, or
:term:`lazy content units<lazy content>`. When serving :term:`lazy content units<lazy content>` the
downloading also happens from within this component as well.

.. note::

   Pulp installs a script that lets you run the content serving app as a standalone service as
   follows:::

      $ pulp-content

The content serving application can be deployed like any aiohttp.server application. See the
`aiohttp Deployment docs <https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment.html>`_ for more
information.


Tasking System
--------------

Pulp's tasking system has two components: a resource manager and workers, all of which are run using
`rq`_.

Worker
  Pulp workers perform most tasks "run" by the tasking system including long-running tasks like
  synchronize and short-running tasks like a Distribution update. Each worker handles one task at a
  time, and additional workers provide more concurrency.

Resource Manager
  A different type of Pulp worker that plays a coordinating role for the tasking system. You must
  run exactly one of these for Pulp to operate correctly.

.. note::

   Pulp serializes tasks that are unsafe to run in parallel, e.g. a sync and publish operation on
   the same repo should not run in parallel. Generally tasks are serialized at the "repo" level, so
   if you have N workers you can process N repo sync's concurrently.

.. _static-content:

Static Content
==============

When browsing the REST API or the browsable documentation with a web browser, for a good experience,
you'll need static content to be served.

In Development
--------------

If using the built-in Django webserver and your settings.yaml has ``DEBUG: True`` then static
content is automatically served for you.

In Production
-------------

For production environments, configure static content as follows:

Collect all of the static content into place using the ``collectstatic`` command
as follows::

    $ pulp-manager collectstatic
