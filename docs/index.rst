Pulp Documentation

The documentation contains 3 types of documents:
(1) Guides: Guides are introductory materials and have relatively little prerequisite knowledge.
Guides focus on high level concepts and practical use.
(2) Reference Material: Reference material is mostly autogenerated and should be used to fully
understand all the details of specific actions.
(3) Topics: In depth explanations of complex concepts, these areas assume that the audience has
read the relevant introductory material, though expected knowledge should be explicitly stated.

For each audience, there are "entry points" that are the start of a linear flow through all the
information that the user would need for a particular topic.

Documentation architecture reflects the recommended linear progression for each of our audiences:
