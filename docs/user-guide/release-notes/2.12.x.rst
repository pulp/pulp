Pulp 2.12 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.12.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Task profiling can now be enabled. This will use `cProfile
  <https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html#module-cProfile>`_ on an individual task and write
  the profile to a directory for a given task. While this can impact performance, this enables users
  to get some insight into what a task is doing or give the output to give to a developer for debugging.

* ``pulp-manage-db`` will not continue if pulp_celerybeat, pulp_resource_manager, or pulp_workers
  processes are running. This prevents the user from corrupting their Pulp installation by applying
  migrations while workers or pulp_celerybeat are running. This works in both standalone and clustered
  installations. Pulp may wait up to 92 seconds to determine if workers are running.

* Worker failure detection and high availability failover occurs within 30 seconds. Pulp processes are
  considered missing after 25 seconds, and heartbeats occur every 5 seconds.

* Failover events are now logged at the WARNING level with a message which explicitly states that
  failover has occurred.


Deprecation
-----------

* Pulp Nodes is now deprecated and will be removed in Pulp 3.0. Users can use a
  Pulp instance and sync repositories to this instance from their main Pulp
  instance instead. For more information, see `our blog post on the subject of
  deprecating Nodes <http://pulpproject.org/2016/12/06/deprecating-nodes/>`_.

Upgrade instructions
--------------------

Upgrade using the normal process::

    $ sudo systemctl stop httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
    $ sudo yum upgrade
    $ sudo -u apache pulp-manage-db
    $ sudo systemctl start httpd pulp_workers pulp_resource_manager pulp_celerybeat pulp_streamer goferd
