Pulp 2.12 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.12.0
===========

New Features
------------

 * Task profiling can now be enabled. This will use cProfiling on an individual task and write the profile to a directory for a given task. While this can impact performance, this can enable users to get some insight into what a task is doing or use the output to give to a developer for debugging.
 * ``pulp-manage-db`` will not continue if pulp_celerybeat, pulp_resource_manager, or pulp_workers
   processes are running. This will prevent the user from corrupting their Pulp installation by
   migrating with running workers. This works in both standalone and clustered installations. Pulp
   may wait up to 92 seconds to determine if workers are running.
 * pulp_workers, pulp_resource_manager, and pulp_celerybeat record their own hearbeats to the
   database. pulp_celerybeat does not need to be running to determine if pulp_resource_manager and
   pulp_workers are online.

Deprecation
-----------

* Pulp Nodes is now deprecated and will be removed in Pulp 3.0. Users can use a
  Pulp instance and sync repositories to this instance from their main Pulp
  instance instead. For more information, see `our blog post on the subject of
  deprecating Nodes <http://pulpproject.org/2016/12/06/deprecating-nodes/>`_.
