Pulp 2.13 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.13.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Log statements which are emitted from task processes now include a short task
  id of 8 characters (i.e. ``pulp.server.sync::INFO: [0ca4399c] ...``) which
  can be used to look up a task.

* Users no longer need to have pulp_celerybeat running to know whether pulp_workers or
  pulp_resource_manager are online. All workers now write their own heartbeat records to the
  database, eliminating the dependence on pulp_celerybeat.

* serial_number_path is removed from server.conf. Pulp now generates the serial number
  randomly and does not use the sn.dat file. This is a part of the fix for :redmine:`1839`
