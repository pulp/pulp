Pulp 2.13 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.13.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Log statements which are emitted from task processes now include a short task
  id of 8 characters (i.e. ``pulp.server.sync::INFO: [0ca4399c] ...``) which
  can be used to look up a task.

* serial_number_path removed from server.conf. Pulp now generates the serial number
  randomly and does not use the sn.dat file. This is a part of the `bugfix for #1839
  <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/1839/>`_
