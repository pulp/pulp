Pulp 2.16 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.16.2
===========

This is a security fix for CVE-2018-1090 which leaks security info via the `last_override_config` on
importers and distributors serialized via the Rest API. See `issue 3521 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/3513>`_
for more information. With this release, that field no longer reports the information saved in the
database. Instead it will always show as::

    'last_override_config': {}
