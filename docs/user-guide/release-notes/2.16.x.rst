* Security fix: `Issue 3521 <https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/3513>`_

  * `CVE-2018-1090 <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1090>`_
  * The `last_override_config` field on importers and distributors was serialized via the Rest API
    and potentially included sensitive information. With this release, that field no longer
    reports the information saved in the database. Instead it will always show as::

    'last_override_config': {}
