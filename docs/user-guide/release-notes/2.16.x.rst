Pulp 2.16 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.16.2
===========

This release contains a security fix for CVE-2018-1090 which leaks security info via the
`last_override_config` on importers and distributors serialized via the Rest API. See `issue 3521
<https://github.com/pulp/pulp/pull/3513>`_ for more information. With this release, that field no
longer reports the information saved in the database. Instead it will always show as::

    'last_override_config': {}


This release also contains some bug fixes for issues that were encountered while trying to run Pulp
in a FIPS enabled environment.
