Pulp 2.10 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.10.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Multiple instances of ``pulp_resource_manager`` can now exist in parallel without interfering with
  each other. The original copy will now hold an exclusive lock until it dies or is killed, at
  which point another instance of ``pulp_resource_manager`` can acquire the lock and take its place.

* Added new option --force-full to sync. This can be used for example in rpm to re-download missing
  files even when the repo revision number has not changed since last sync.
  This option can be used by `force_full` option in `override_config` via API or
  `--force-full` via CLI.
