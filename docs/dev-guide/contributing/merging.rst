Merging

Pull Requests
-------------

You have some commits in a branch, and you're ready to merge. The Pulp Team
makes use of pull requests for all contributions. Please have a look at our
:doc:`Contribution checklist <index>`.

On the GitHub page for the repo where your development branch lives, there will be
a "Pull Request" button. Click it. From there you will choose the source and
destination branches.

If there is a bug for this issue, please title the pull request "<bug_id> -
Short Message". In the comment section below, please include a link to the
issue. Use of GitHub's markdown for the link is prefered. Example:
``[Issue 123456](https://link.tobug)`` Additionally, please also include a
link to the pull request in the bugs notes.

If there is a Redmine issue associated with the commit, please add ``closes
#<issue number>`` somewhere in the commit. This will set the issue to
``MODIFIED`` upon merging. Additionally, you can add ``re #<issue number> <some
message>`` which will add a comment to the issue upon merging.

For details about using pull requests, see GitHub's
`official documentation <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.


Review
------

Once a pull request has been submitted, a member of the team will review it.
That person can indicate their intent to review a particular pull request by
assigning it to themself.

Comments on a pull request are meant to be helpful for the patch author. They
may point out critical flaws, suggest more efficient approaches, express admiration
for your work, ask questions, make jokes, etc. Once review is done, the reviewer
assigns the pull request back to the author. The next step for the author will
go in one of two directions:

1. If you have commit access and can merge the pull request yourself, you can
   take the comments for whatever you think they are worth. Use your own
   judgement, make any revisions you see fit, and merge when you are satisfied.
   Think of the review like having someone proof-read your paper in college.

2. If you are a community member and do not have commit access, we ask that you
   take the review more literally. Since the Pulp Team is accepting responsibility
   for maintaining your code into perpetuity, please address all concerns expressed
   by the reviewer, and assign it back to them when you are done. The reviewer
   will strive to make it clear which issues are blocking your pull request from
   being merged.

.. note::
   *To the community:* The Pulp Team is very grateful for your contribution and
   values your involvement tremendously! There are few things in an OSS project as
   satisfying as receiving a pull request from the community.

   We are very open and honest when we review each other's work. We will do our
   best to review your contribution with respect and professionalism. In return,
   we hope you will accept our review process as an opportunity for everyone to
   learn something, and to make Pulp the best product it can be. If you are
   uncertain about comments or instructions, please let us know!


.. _rebasing-and-squashing:

Rebasing and Squashing
----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, consider an interactive rebase with some
squashing. We prefer each PR to contain a single commit. This offers some
significant advantages:

- Squashing makes it more likely that your merge will be fast-forward only, which
  helps avoid conflicts.
- Nobody wants to see your typo fixes in the commit log. Consider squashing
  trivial commits so that each commit you merge is as story-focused as possible.
- The ``git commit --amend`` command is very useful, but be sure that you
  `understand what it does <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-commit--amend>`_
  before you use it! GitHub will update the PR and keep the comments when you force
  push an amended commit.
- Rebasing makes cherry picking features and bug fixes much simpler.

If this is not something that you are comfortable with, an excellent resource can be
found here:

`How to Rebase a Pull Request <https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/How-to-Rebase-a-Pull-Request>`_

.. warning::
   Keep in mind that rebasing creates new commits that are unique from your
   original commits. Thus, if you have three commits and rebase them, you must
   make sure that all copies of those original commits get deleted. Did you push
   your branch to origin? Delete it and re-push after the rebase.


.. _merging-checklist:

Merging Checklist
-----------------

Before you merge your Pull Request on Github, here is a list of things to
consider. Note that not all may be applicable to your change. For example, a
pulp-smash test plan is not needed for changes that only refactor code.

- Post the Github pull request URL as a comment on the plan.io issue and
  transition the state of the issue to POST
- Add and associate a `pulp-smash test plan
  <https://github.com/PulpQE/pulp-smash/issues>`_ to your plan.io issue if
  needed
- If your change is a new feature, add a release note
- If your change is a new feature, add documentation for the feature


.. _merging-your-changes:

Merging your Changes
--------------------

After a PR is marked as approved by all reviewers, you can then merge your
changes. First, hit the "Merge pull request" button on your PR on the Github
website.

You will now need to merge your changes forward. Here are the rules for merging forward:

- If your commit is on ``X.Y-dev``, you want to merge ``X.Y-dev`` to  the next
  higher version's dev branch. This will typically be ``X.Y+1-dev``.
- When you are done merging through the various dev branches, merge the highest
  dev branch to ``master``.

For example, if you merge a PR to ``2.7-dev`` and the only newer dev branch
is ``2.8-dev``, you would merge ``2.7-dev`` into ``2.8-dev``, then ``2.8-dev``
into ``master``.

You will also want to set the "Target Release" field in the redmine issue.
"Target Release" is available for Issues, Refactors, and Stories but not for
Tasks. If you have a task that appears to need a target release, please
consider using one of the other three issue types.

For cases where there are substantial merge conflicts whose resolution merits
review, create a new branch from your working branch and merge the dev branch
into it. For example, assume you have branch ``hot-new-feature`` based on the
``2.7-dev`` branch, and substantial conflicts merging to ``2.8-dev``.

::

  $ git checkout hot-new-feature
  $ git checkout -b hot-new-feature-2.8
  $ git merge 2.8-dev

At this point you can resolve conflicts, then create a pull request from
hot-new-feature-2.8 into 2.8-dev.


Merging to Old Releases Only
----------------------------

Infrequently, there may be a need to apply a change to an old release but not
newer releases. This should only be a last resort.

One way or another, it is important to merge this change into newer release
branches, even if the actual changes don't get applied. When fixing code that
no longer exists in newer branches, simply do the merge and resolve any
conflicts that arise.

Otherwise, to merge the work but not apply any of its code changes, use merge
strategy "ours".

::

  $ git merge -s ours my-important-fix

In either case, git's history records that your fix has been applied to each
branch. Make sure the human-readable description of your fix accurately
describes its scope. For more on how to write a good commit message, see the
Commit Messages section of our `branching page </dev-guide/branching>`_.
