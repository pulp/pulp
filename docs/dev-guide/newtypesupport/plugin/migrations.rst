Migrations
==========

From time to time, you might wish to adjust the schema of your database objects. The Pulp platform provides
a migration system to assist you with this process. In this section of the guide, we will discuss how to
configure your project's migrations.

Registration
============

In order to write migrations for your Pulp plugin, you will need to register your plugin's
migrations package with the Pulp server.

How to Register
---------------

There are a few steps you will need to perform in order to configure your project to advertise
itself to Pulp's migration system. First you will need to create a migrations Python package in
your project's plugin space. For example, the Pulp RPM project has its migrations at
``pulp_rpm.migrations``. You don't have to call it "migrations", but that's a reasonable choice of
name.

Second, you will need to use the
`Python entry points system <http://packages.python.org/distribute/pkg_resources.html#entry-points>`_
to advertise your migration package to Pulp. To do that, add an entry_points argument to in your
`setup()` function in your setup.py file, like this::

	setup(<other_arguments>, entry_points = {
        <other_entry_points>,
        'pulp.server.db.migrations': [
            '<your_project_name> = <path.to.migrations.package>'
        ]
    })

It's important that the entry point name "pulp.server.db.migrations" be used here. To clarify this with an
example, the Pulp RPM project's setup.py has this as it's entry_points setup argument::

	entry_points = {
        'pulp.distributors': [
            'distributor = pulp_rpm.plugins.distributors.iso_distributor.distributor:entry_point',
        ],
        'pulp.importers': [
            'importer = pulp_rpm.plugins.importers.iso_importer.importer:entry_point',
        ],
        'pulp.server.db.migrations': [
            'pulp_rpm = pulp_rpm.migrations'
        ]
    }

Once you have that in your `setup()` function, you will need to install your package using your setup.py
file. This will advertise your package's migrations to Pulp, and you will be registered with Pulp's migration
system. Once you have installed your package, you should run ``pulp-manage-db``, and you should see some
output that mentions your migration package::

	$ sudo pulp-manage-db  
	Beginning database migrations.
	Migration package pulp.server.db.migrations is up to date at version 2
	Migration package pulp_rpm.migrations is up to date at version 4
	Migration package <path.to.migrations.package> is up to date at version 0
	Database migrations complete.
	Loading content types.
	Content types loaded.

It should say that your package is at version 0, because you haven't written any migrations yet. We'll talk
about that next.

Creating Migrations
===================

In the event that you need to make an adjustment to your data in Pulp, you should write a migration
script. There are a few rules to follow for migration scripts, and if you follow them carefully,
nobody gets hurt. Here are the rules:

#. Migration scripts should be modules in your migrations package.
#. Each migration module should be named starting with a version number.
#. Your migration version numbers are significant. Pulp tracks which version each install has been
   migrated to. It requires your migration versions to start with 1, and to be sequential with no
   gaps in version numbers. For example, 0001_my_first_migration.py, 0002_my_second_migration.py,
   0003_add_email_addresses_to_users.py, etc. You don't have to use leading zeros in the names, as
   the number is processed with a regular expression that interprets it as an integer. However, the
   advantage to using leading zeros is that programs like ``ls`` will display your migrations in
   order when you inspect the contents of your migration package.
#. Each migration module should have a function called "migrate" with this signature:
   ``def migrate(*args, **kwargs)``.
#. Inside your ``migrate()`` function, you can perform the necessary work to change the data in the
   Pulp install.
#. Your ``migrate()`` function must be written in such a way that it will not fail for a new
   installation. New installations will start at migration version 0, and all migrations up to the
   most recent migration will be applied by the system. Therefore, you must not assume that there
   is data in the database, or on the filesystem. Your migration script should detect what work, if
   any, needs to be done before performing any operations.

For example, your migrations package might look like this::

	migrations
 	|
	|-- __init__.py
	|-- 0001_rename_user_to_username.py
	|-- 0002_remove_spaces_from_username.py
	|-- 0003_recalculate_unit_hashes.py

Here's what the first migration, 0001_rename_user_to_username.py, might look like::

	# Getting the db handle is left as an exercise for the reader
	from somewhere import initialize_db
	
	def migrate(*args, **kwargs):
		"""
		We want to rename the 'user' attribute in our users collection to 'username' for clarity.
		"""
		db = initialize_db()
		db.users.update({}, {'$rename': {'user': 'username'}})
