.. _getting_the_server_status:

Getting the Server Status
-------------------------

An unauthenticated resource that shows the current status of the Pulp server. A
200 response shows that the server is up and running. Users of this API may
want to examine ``pulp_messaging_connection``, ``pulp_database_connection``
and ``known_workers`` to get more detailed status information.

.. warning:: Clustered Pulp installations have additional monitoring concerns.
    See :ref:`clustered_monitoring` for more information.

.. note:: This API is meant to provide an "at-a-glance" status to aid debugging
    of a Pulp deployment, and is not meant to replace monitoring of Pulp
    components in a production environment.

A healthy Pulp installation will contain exactly one record for "resource_manager", one
or more records for "pulp_celerybeat", and one or more records for "reserved_resource_worker".
It will also have``messaging_connection`` and ``database_connection`` entries that contain
``{connected: True}``. Note that if pulp_celerybeat is not running, other workers may be
running but not updating their last heartbeat record.

The version of Pulp is also returned via ``platform_version`` in the
``versions`` object. This field is calculated from the "pulp-server" python
package version. Do not use the deprecated ``api_version`` record.
