Getting the Server Status
-------------------------

An unauthenticated resource that shows the current status of the Pulp server. A
200 response shows that the server is up and running. Users of this API may
want to examine ``pulp_messaging_connection``, ``pulp_database_connection``
and ``known_workers`` to get more detailed status information.

Note that this API is meant to provide an "at-a-glance" status to aid debugging
of a Pulp deployment, and is not meant to replace monitoring of Pulp components
in a production environment.

A healthy Pulp installation will contain exactly one record for
"resource_manager" and "scheduler" in the worker list, and one or more
"reserved_resource_worker" records. It will also have
``messaging_connection`` and ``database_connection`` entries that contain ``{connected: True}``.
Note that if the scheduler is not running, other workers may be running but not
updating their last heartbeat record.

The version of Pulp is also returned via ``platform_version`` in the
``versions`` object. This field is calculated from the "pulp-server" python
package version. Do not use the deprecated ``api_version`` record.
