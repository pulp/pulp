Why you should use Pulp
=======================

Pulp is used "To Acquire, Organize, and Distribute Software"

Pulp can **aquire** content from external sources and through direct uploads.

Pulp helps you **organize** your content into **repositories**, which are **versioned**. Users can
manage their repositories using established, well documented workflows.

Pulp can **host and distribute** the content in your **repositories**.

In short, users are enabled to **own their dependencies** and **simply manage software
lifecycles**. Best of all, Pulp is generalized and plugins TODO(link) allow content management for
arbitrary types. If a plugin doesn't already exist, a simple implementation TODO(link to
plugin_template) is easy to create with clear instructions TODO(link, plugin-writer-guide).
