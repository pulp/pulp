Plugins
=======

Plugins add support for a type of content to Pulp. For example, the
`file_plugin <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_file>`_ adds support for Pulp to manage files.

For a list of plugins check out our `list of plugins for Pulp 3 <https://pulpproject.org/pulp-3-plugins/>`_.

Developers interested in writing plugins should reference the `Pulp Plugin API
<../../../pulpcore-plugin/nightly/>`_ documentation.

And don't hesitate to :ref:`contact us<community>` with any questions during development.
Let us know when the plugin is ready and we will be happy to add it to the list of available plugins for Pulp!
