The Pulp :doc:`../plugin-api/index` is versioned separately from the Pulp Core and consists
of everything importable within the :mod:`pulpcore.plugin` namespace. When writing plugins, care should
be taken to only import Pulp Core components exposed in this namespace; importing from elsewhere
within the Pulp Core (e.g. importing directly from ``pulpcore.app``, ``pulpcore.exceptions``, etc.)
is unsupported, and not protected by the Pulp Plugin API's semantic versioning guarantees.

.. warning::

    # TODO(asmacdo) Revise this
    Exactly what is versioned in the Plugin API, and how, still has yet to be determined.
    This documentation will be updated to clearly identify what guarantees come with the
    semantic versioning of the Plugin API in the future. As our initial plugins are under
    development prior to the release of Pulp 3.0, the Plugin API can be assumed to have
    semantic major version 0, indicating it is unstable and still being developed.
