Plugin API
==========

The Pulp Plugin API is versioned separately from Pulp Core. It is governed by `semantic
versioning <http://semver.org/>`_. Backwards incompatible changes may be made until the
Plugin API reaches stability with v1.0. For the latest version of the Plugin API see
:doc:`release notes <../../release-notes/index>`.
