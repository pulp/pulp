Content Management
==================

Install Content on a Consumer
-----------------------------

Install one or more content units on a consumer.  This operation is asynchronous.
If dependencies are automatically installed or updated, it is reflected in the
installation report.

The units to be installed are specified in an array.  Each unit in the  array of *units* is an
object containing two required attributes.  The first is the **type_id** which a string
that defines the unit's content type.  The value is unrestricted by the Pulp server but
must match a type mapped to a content :term:`handler` in the agent.  The second is the
**unit_key** which identifies the unit or units to be installed.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.

The caller can pass additional options using an *options* object.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.  The options drive how the handler performs the operation.

Update Content on a Consumer
----------------------------

Update one or more content units on a consumer.  This operation is asynchronous.
If dependencies are automatically installed or updated, it is reflected in the
update report.

The units to be updated are specified in an array.  Each unit in the array of *units* is an
object containing two required attributes.  The first is the **type_id** which a string
that defines the unit's content type.  The value is unrestricted by the Pulp server but
must match a type mapped to a content :term:`handler` in the agent.  The second is the
**unit_key** which identifies the unit or units to be updated.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.

The caller can pass additional options using an *options* object.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.  The options drive how the handler performs the operation.

Uninstall Content on a Consumer
-------------------------------

Uninstall one or more content units on a consumer.  This operation is asynchronous.
If dependencies are automatically removed, it is reflected in the uninstall report.

The units to be uninstalled are specified in an array.  Each unit in the array of *units* is an
object containing two required attributes.  The first is the **type_id** which a string
that defines the unit's content type.  The value is unrestricted by the Pulp server but
must match a type mapped to a content :term:`handler` in the agent.  The second is the
**unit_key** which identifies the unit or units to be uninstalled.  The value is completely
defined by the handler mapped to the unit's type_id.

The caller can pass additional options using an *options* object.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.  The options drive how the handler performs the operation.
