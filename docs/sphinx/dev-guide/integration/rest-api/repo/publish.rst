Publication
===========

.. _repository_publish:

Publish a Repository
--------------------

Publish content from a repository using a repository's :term:`distributor`. This
call always executes asynchronously and will return a :term:`call report`.

| :method:`post`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/actions/publish/`
| :permission:`execute`
| :param_list:`post`

* :param:`id,str,identifies which distributor on the repository to publish`
* :param:`?override_config,object,distributor configuration values that override the distributor's default configuration for this publish`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`202, if the publish is set to be executed`
* :response_code:`409, if a conflicting operation is in progress`

| :return:`a` :ref:`call_report` representing the current state of they sync`

:sample_request:`_` ::

 {
   "id": "distributor_1",
   "override_config": {},
 }

**Tags:**
The task created will have the following tags:
``"pulp:action:publish","pulp:repository:<repo_id>"``


Scheduling a Publish
--------------------
A repository can be published automatically using an :term:`iso8601 interval`.
To create a scheduled publish, the interval, publish override config, and other
schedule options must be set on a repository's :term:`distributor`.

| :method:`post`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/distributors/<distributor_id>/publish_schedules/`
| :permission:`create`
| :param_list:`post`

* :param:`schedule,string,the schedule as an iso8601 interval`
* :param:`?override_config,object,the overridden configuration for the distributor to be used on the scheduled publish`
* :param:`?failure_threshold,number,consecutive failures allowed before this scheduled publish is disabled`
* :param:`?enabled,boolean,whether the scheduled publish is initially enabled (defaults to true)`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`201,if the schedule was successfully created`

| :return:`schedule report representing the current state of the scheduled call`

:sample_request:`_` ::

 {
  "override_config": {},
  "schedule": "PT1H",
  "failure_threshold": 3,
 }

Updating a Scheduled Publish
----------------------------
The same parameters used to create a scheduled publish may be updated at any point.

| :method:`put`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/distributors/<distributor_id>/publish_schedules/<schedule_id>/`
| :permission:`create`
| :param_list:`put`

* :param:`?schedule,string,new schedule as an iso8601 interval`
* :param:`?override_config,object,new overridden configuration for the importer to be used on the scheduled sync`
* :param:`?failure_threshold,number,new consecutive failures allowed before this scheduled sync is disabled`
* :param:`?enabled,boolean,whether the scheduled sync is enabled`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`200,if the schedule was successfully updated`

| :return:`schedule report representing the current state of the scheduled call (see sample response of Scheduling a Publish for details)`


Deleting a Scheduled Publish
----------------------------
Delete a scheduled publish to remove it permanently from the distributor.

| :method:`delete`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/distributors/<distributor_id>/publish_schedules/<schedule_id>/`
| :permission:`delete`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`200,if the schedule was deleted successfully`

| :return:`null`


Listing All Scheduled Publishes
-------------------------------
All of the scheduled publishes for a given distributor may be listed.

| :method:`get`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/distributors/<distributor_id>/publish_schedules/`
| :permission:`read`
| :return:`array of schedule reports for all scheduled publishes defined (see sample response of Scheduling a Publish for details)`


Listing a Single Scheduled Publish
----------------------------------
Each scheduled publish may be inspected.

| :method:`get`
| :permission:`read`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/distributors/<distributor_id>/publish_schedules/<schedule_id>/`
| :return:`a schedule report for the scheduled publish (see sample response of Scheduling a Publish for details)`


Retrieving Publish History
--------------------------
Retrieve publish history for a repository. Each publish performed on a repository creates a history entry.

| :method:`get`
| :permission:`read`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/history/publish/<distributor_id>/`

| :param_list:`get`

* :param:`?limit,integer,the maximum number of history entries to return; if not specified, the entire
  history is returned`
* :param:`?sort,string,options are 'ascending' and 'descending'; the array is sorted by the publish timestamp`
* :param:`?start_date,iso8601 datetime,any entries with a timestamp prior to the given date are not returned`
* :param:`?end_date,iso8601 datetime,any entries with a timestamp after the given date are not returned`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`200,if the history was successfully retrieved`
* :response_code:`404,if the repository id given does not exist`

| :return:`an array of publish history entries`
