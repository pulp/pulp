These policies apply to code that is supported by the Pulp Team. Third-party
code can of course do as it may, but you are encouraged to follow these policies
so that:

- Other Pulp developers will have an easy time working with your code.
- Your code is compatible with existing Pulp deployments.
- There is the option for your code to one day become an official part of the
  Pulp Project, and thus supported by the Pulp Team.
