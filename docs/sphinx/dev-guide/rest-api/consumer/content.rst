Content Management
==================

Install Content on a Consumer
-----------------------------

Install one or more content units on a consumer.  This operation is asynchronous.
If dependencies are automatically installed or updated, it is reflected in the
installation report.

The units to be installed are specified in a list.  Each unit in the list of *units* is an
object containing two required attributes.  The first is the **type_id** which a string
that defines the unit's content type.  The value is unrestricted by the Pulp server but
must match a type mapped to a content :term:`handler` in the agent.  The second is the
**unit_key** which identifies the unit or units to be installed.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.

The caller can pass additional options using an *options* object.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.  The options drive how the handler performs the operation.

Update Content on a Consumer
----------------------------

Update one or more content units on a consumer.  This operation is asynchronous.
If dependencies are automatically installed or updated, it is reflected in the
update report.

The units to be updated are specified in a list.  Each unit in the list of *units* is an
object containing two required attributes.  The first is the **type_id** which a string
that defines the unit's content type.  The value is unrestricted by the Pulp server but
must match a type mapped to a content :term:`handler` in the agent.  The second is the
**unit_key** which identifies the unit or units to be updated.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.

The caller can pass additional options using an *options* object.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.  The options drive how the handler performs the operation.

* :param:`options,object,update options`

* :response_code:`400,if one or more of the parameters is invalid`

Uninstall Content on a Consumer
-------------------------------

Uninstall one or more content units on a consumer.  This operation is asynchronous.
If dependencies are automatically removed, it is reflected in the uninstall report.

The units to be uninstalled are specified in a list.  Each unit in the list of *units* is an
object containing two required attributes.  The first is the **type_id** which a string
that defines the unit's content type.  The value is unrestricted by the Pulp server but
must match a type mapped to a content :term:`handler` in the agent.  The second is the
**unit_key** which identifies the unit or units to be uninstalled.  The value is completely
defined by the handler mapped to the unit's type_id.

The caller can pass additional options using an *options* object.  Both the structure and
content are handler specific.  The options drive how the handler performs the operation.

| :method:`post`
| :path:`/v2/consumers/<consumer_id>/actions/content/uninstall/`

* :param:`options,object,uninstall options`

* :response_code:`400,if one or more of the parameters is invalid`
* :response_code:`404,if the consumer does not exist`
