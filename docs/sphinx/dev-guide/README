From this directory, run:

  make clean && make html

The built documentation will be under _build/html

reST Cheatsheet

Below are a few useful commands to know:
* Bold is gotten by wrapping the text with double *. Example: **awesome**
* Italics is wrapped with single *. Example: *rock*
* A link to the glossary is done using the :term: role. The value of the role
  is the text to include as the link and then the actual target in the glossary.
  For example: :term:`distributors <distributor>` will name the link "distributors"
  and reference the distributor entry in the glossary.
* Adding an entry in the glossary is very simple, just follow the format of an
  existing item in glossary.rst.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
API Pages

APIs should be divided into logical groupings to keep from making pages too
long and cumbersome to deal with. The page title should be rendered as a reST
section using = as the underline. For example:

Creation and Configuration
==========================

Each individual API then uses - as the underline:

Create a Repository
-------------------

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
API Template

Below is the template used for a single API. Things to keep in mind:

* For response_list and sample_request, the `_` part is required.
* For sample_request, make sure to have a space after the ` and before ::
* Variables in a path are denoted by <> (e.g. /repositories/<repo_id>/)
* Order response codes in ascending order
* A ? at the start of a param name will flag it as optional
* param_list takes the method value as an argument
* sample_response takes the code of the response being sampled

See ../extensions/rest_api.py for the implementations of each role used in the
template below. The docstrings for each role method describe the format of the
values to pass to each role.
