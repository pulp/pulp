Installation
============

Pulp operates with three main components that get installed potentially on different
machines.

* Server: This is the main application server that stores data and distributes content.
* Agent: This component runs on consumers and communicates with the server to handle distributed content.
* Client: This is a command line component that comes as two pieces: admin-client,
    which manages the server; and consumer-client, which manages a consumer's relationship
    to the server. admin-client can be run from any machine that can access the server's
    REST API, but the consumer-client must be run on a consumer.

Prerequisites
-------------

* On RHEL 5, Pulp does not currently work with SELinux. SELinux must be
  set to Permissive or Disabled.
* Pulp Server does not run on RHEL 5.
* The following ports must be open into the server:

 * 80 for consumers to access repositories served over HTTP
 * 443 for consumers to access repositories served over HTTPS
 * 443 for clients (both admin and consumer) to access Pulp APIs
 * 5672 for consumers to connect to the message bus if it is left unsecured
 * 5671 for consumers to connect to the message bus if it is running over HTTPS

* The mod_python Apache module must be uninstalled or not loaded. Pulp uses
  mod_wsgi which conflicts with mod_python and will cause the server to fail.

Repositories
------------

1. Download the appropriate repo definition file from the Pulp repository:

 * Fedora: http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/fedora-pulp.repo
 * RHEL: http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/pulp/pulp/rhel-pulp.repo

.. note::
  Currently, the only enabled repository in these files is the v1 production
  repository. These instructions apply to the v2 codebase. As such, be sure
  to disable the v1 repositories and enable one of the v2 repository definitions
  in the above files.

2. For RHEL systems, the EPEL repositories are required. More information can
   be found at: `<http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#howtouse>`_

3. For RHEL 5 systems, subscribe to the following RHN channels:

 * MRG Messaging v. 1
 * MRG Messaging Base v. 1

4. QPID RPMs are not available in the default CentOS repositories. Instructions
   on building those RPMs can be found at :ref:`centos-build-qpid-rpms`.

Server
------
.. configure qpid with SSL (jortel knows about this, might have a wiki page about it)


1. Install the Pulp server and its dependencies.

::

  $ sudo yum groupinstall pulp-server

2. Update ``/etc/pulp/server.conf`` to reflect the hostname of the server.

::

   [messaging]
   url: tcp://localhost:5672
   ...
   [server]
   server_name: localhost

3. Configure the server in /etc/pulp/server.conf. Most defaults will work, but
these are sections you might consider looking at before proceeding. Each section
is documented in-line.

* **email** if you intend to have the server send email (off by default)
* **database** if you want to use non-default database settings
* **messaging** if your qpid server is on a different host or if you want to use SSL
* **security** to provide your own SSL CA certificates, which is a good idea if
    you intend to use Pulp in production
* **server** if you want to change the server's URL components or default credentials

4. Start each service and set them to start at boot.

::

  $ sudo service mongod start
  $ sudo chkconfig mongod on
  $ sudo service qpidd start
  $ sudo chkconfig qpidd on
  $ sudo service httpd start
  $ sudo chkconfig httpd on


.. warning::
  On new MongoDB installations, the start call may exit before the database is
  actually running. In these cases, this call will fail with an error about
  the connection failing. If this occurs, give MongoDB a few minutes to finish
  initializing and attempt this call again.

5. Initialize Pulp's database.

::

  $ pulp-manage-db


Admin Client
------------

The Pulp Admin Client is used for administrative commands on the Pulp server,
such as the manipulation of repositories and content. The Pulp Admin Client can
be run on any machine that can access the Pulp server's REST API, including the
server itself. It is not a requirement that the admin client be run on a machine
that is configured as a Pulp consumer.

Pulp admin commands are accessed through the ``pulp-admin`` script.


1. Install the Pulp admin client packages:

::

  $ sudo yum groupinstall pulp-admin

2. Update the admin client configuration to point to the Pulp server. Keep in mind
   that because of the SSL verification, this should be the fully qualified name of the server,
   even if it is the same machine (localhost will not work with the default apache
   generated SSL certificate). Regardless, the "host" setting below must match the
   "CN" value of the server's HTTP SSL certificate.
   This change is made globally to the ``/etc/pulp/admin/admin.conf`` file, or
   for one user in ``~/.pulp/admin.conf``:

::

  [server]
  host = localhost.localdomain


Consumer Client
---------------

The Pulp Consumer Client is present on all systems that wish to act as a consumer
of a Pulp server. The Pulp Consumer Client provides the means for a system to
register and configure itself with a Pulp server. Additionally, the Pulp Consumer
Client runs an agent that will receive messages and commands from the Pulp server.

Pulp consumer commands are accessed through the ``pulp-consumer`` script. This
script must be run as root to permit access to add references to the Pulp server's
repositories.

1. Install the Pulp consumer client and agent packages:

::

  $ sudo yum groupinstall pulp-consumer

2. Update the consumer client configuration to point to the Pulp server. Keep in mind
   that because of the SSL verification, this should be the fully qualified name of the server,
   even if it is the same machine (localhost will not work with the default Apache
   generated SSL certificate). Regardless, the "host" setting below must match the
   "CN" value of the server's HTTP SSL certificate.
   This change is made to the ``/etc/pulp/consumer/consumer.conf`` file:

::

  [server]
  host = localhost.localdomain


3. Start the agent:

::

  $ sudo service pulp-agent start
