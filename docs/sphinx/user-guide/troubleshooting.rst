Troubleshooting
===============


Log File Locations
------------------

/var/log/pulp/pulp.log
  Pulp server logs its activity here

/var/log/pulp/db.log
  database log

/var/log/httpd/ssl_error_log
  This is where Apache will log errors that the Pulp server itself did not
  handle. 5xx level HTTP response codes generally get logged here, often with
  a stack trace or other information that can help a developer determine what
  went wrong.

~/.pulp/admin.log
  pulp-admin logs its activity here.

~/.pulp/consumer.log
  pulp-consumer logs its activity here.

~/.pulp/server_calls.log
  HTTP requests and responses get logger by the admin and consumer clients in
  this file. To enable/disable this, consult the ``[logging]`` section of
  ``/etc/pulp/admin/admin.conf``.


Common Issues
-------------

The server hostname configured on the client did not match the name found in the server's SSL certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In some distributions, such as RHEL 6.3 and Fedora 17, the default SSL certificate
used by Apache is created with its Common Name set to the hostname of the machine.
This can cause Pulp to return an error similar to ``The server hostname configured
on the client did not match the name found in the server's SSL certificate.``

If you want to connect to localhost, you need to regenerate this certificate,
which is stored in /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt. For testing purposes, delete
it, then run ``make testcert``. Be sure to answer "localhost" for the
"Common Name". Other responses do not matter.

For production installations of Pulp, it is up to the installer to provide
appropriate SSL certificates.
