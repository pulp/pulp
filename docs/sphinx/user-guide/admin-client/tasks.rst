Tasks
=====


Introduction
------------

The Pulp server uses `Celery <http://www.celeryproject.org>`_ to handle requests that may
take longer than a HTTP request timeout to execute. Many of the commands from the
**pulp-admin** command line client will return messages along the lines of

::

 Request accepted

 check status of task e239ae4f-7fad-4004-bfb6-8e06f17d22ef with "pulp-admin tasks details"

This means the server's REST API returned a 202 ACCEPTED response with the task
information for the task that is handling the request.

This page details querying and managing these tasks.


Details
-------

The **pulp-admin** command line client provides the ``tasks`` section and the
``details`` command to inspect the runtime details of a task, identified with the
required ``--task-id=<id>`` flag.

::

 $ pulp-admin tasks details --task-id e239ae4f-7fad-4004-bfb6-8e06f17d22ef
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                               Task Details
 +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Operations:
 Resources:    orphans (content_unit)
 State:        Successful
 Start Time:   2012-12-09T03:26:51Z
 Finish Time:  2012-12-09T03:26:51Z

 Task Id:      e239ae4f-7fad-4004-bfb6-8e06f17d22ef
 Progress:

In the output above there are several sections:

 * *Operations*: a list of operations that are being performed by this task
 * *Resources*: a list of resources that are being operated on
 * *State*: the state of the task, such as: Waiting, Running, Successful or Error
 * *Start Time*: the UTC time the task started
 * *Finish Time*: the UTC time the task finished
 * *Result*: the reported result of the task, if any
 * *Task Id*: a unique identifier for the task (as a UUID)
 * *Progress*: arbitrary progress information provided by the task, if any


Listing
-------

To see all the tasks on the server at any given time, the **pulp-admin**
command line client provides the ``tasks`` section and the ``list`` command.

It provides all the same information as the ``details`` command, but for every
task currently operating on the pulp server.


Canceling a Task
----------------

Tasks may be canceled before they are run (i.e. in the waiting state) or while
they are running.

The **pulp-admin** command line client provides the ``tasks`` section and the
``cancel`` command to cancel a task identified by the required
``--task-id`` flag.

::

 $ pulp-admin tasks cancel --task-id e0e0a250-eded-468f-9d97-0419a00b130f

 $ pulp-admin tasks details --task-id e0e0a250-eded-468f-9d97-0419a00b130f

.. Note::

   It is possible for tasks to complete or experience an error before the task cancellation request
   is processed. In these instances, the task's final state might not be "canceled" even though a
   cancel was requested.
