Pulp 2.5 Release Notes
=========================

Pulp 2.5.1
===========

New Features
------------

- Pulp no longer requires additional configuration of Qpid after installation.
  It now works with the ANONYMOUS authentication mechanism. Users can still use a
  username/password however if they set up a SASL database as described in the
  installation document.


Rest API Changes
----------------

* A new `Task Report` attribute named `worker_name` is introduced that holds the name of the worker
  a task is associated with. Previously the worker name was stored in a `Task Report` attribute
  named `queue`. The `queue` attribute now correctly records the queue a task is put in. The
  `queue` attribute is deprecated and will be removed from the `Task Report` in Pulp 3.0.0.

* The URL for the content catalog entries ``/v2/content/catalog/<source-id>`` is missing
  the trailing '/' and has been deprecated. Support for the URL ``/v2/content/catalog/<source-id>/``
  has been added.

Upgrade Instructions for 2.5.0 --> 2.5.1
-----------------------------------------

Prior to upgrading, all tasks must be stopped. One way to accomplish this is to stop all
`pulp_workers`, `pulp_celerybeat`, and `pulp_resource_manager` processes and then list the current
tasks using:

::

    pulp-admin tasks list

Any task that is in the "Running" or "Waiting" state should be canceled by its <uuid> using:

::

    pulp-admin tasks cancel --task-id <uuid>

After all tasks have been canceled upgrade the packages using:

::

    sudo yum update

After yum completes you should restart `httpd`, `pulp_workers`, `pulp_celerybeat`, and
`pulp_resource_manager`.


Pulp 2.5.0
===========

New Features
------------

- pulp-admin now has a bash tab completion script.

- A new selinux policy that confines the pulp_workers, pulp_celerybeat, and
  pulp_resource_manager

- Pulp 2.5.0 includes `pulp_docker`, an optional plugin to manage Docker
  repositories. In Pulp 2.5.0 this optional plugin is considered "tech preview"
  and did not undergo the same level of testing as other plugins. Please
  refer to the
  `pulp_docker documentation <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_docker/tree/master/docs/user-guide>`_
  for usage information.

- Pulp now supports SSL on its connection to MongoDB. It is strongly recommended that you
  `configure MongoDB to perform SSL`_, and configure Pulp to require a validly signed certificate
  from Mongo. If you wish to do this, edit ``/etc/pulp/server.conf`` and configure ``ssl`` and
  ``verify_ssl`` to ``true`` in the ``[database]`` section.

.. _configure MongoDB to perform SSL: http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.4/tutorial/configure-ssl/#configure-mongod-and-mongos-for-ssl

Deprecation
-----------

- The `task_type` attribute of a `Task Report` is deprecated with Pulp 2.5.0.  This attribute will
  be removed in a future release.
