API Changes
-----------

* Schedule delete no longer returns a 404 when the schedule is not found. It will
  return a 200, because this is exactly the condition the user asked for.
* Deleting units is no longer blocked if the user performing the delete is different
  than the user that created the unit.  This most notably has the effect of eliminating
  the restriction that units could not be deleted from repositories that are synced via a feed.
  However, if a unit is deleted from a repo populated via a feed, syncing the repo again will
  recreate the unit.
* The structure of the Call Report has been changed significantly.  It now returns a single
  object under all conditions.  The spawned_tasks list within that object does not contain
  the full list of all tasks that will be scheduled for a given call.  Each spawned task
  is responsible for spawning whatever additional tasks are needed in order to complete processing
  For example, the sync task with auto publishing enabled returns a Call Report that only lists
  the task_id for the sync portion of the work.  When the sync task finishes it will have the
  task created for publishing listed in the spawned_tasks field.
* The exception & traceback fields have been deprecated from the Call Report & Task Status objects
  In place of those fields a new "error" object has been created and will be returned.
* TaskGroups are no longer supported.  All usages of the task_group_id have been removed.
* When asynchronous tasks are created they will be returned in the waiting state.  The
  postponed or rejected states are no longer supported.


ScheduledCall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ScheduledCall model has changed substantially.

* ``last_run`` is now ``last_run_at``
* ``args`` and ``kwargs`` are now top-level attributes of the object.
* ``task`` is a new attribute that is the python path to the task this schedule will execute.
* ``resource`` is a new attribute that is a globally-unique identifier for the object
  this task will operate on. It is used internally to query schedules based on a given resource.

CRUD operations on schedules no longer depend on resource locking, so these API
operations will never return a 202 or 409.

Upgrade Instructions for 2.3.x --> 2.4.0
----------------------------------------

To upgrade to the new Pulp release from version 2.3.x, you should begin by using yum to install the
latest RPMs from the Pulp repository and run the database migrations::

    $ sudo yum upgrade
    $ sudo pulp-manage-db

Pulp 2.4.0 comes with some new services that perform distributed tasks using Celery. You can read
about this more in the :ref:`Installation Guide <distributed_workers_installation>`. You will need
to enable Pulp's workers on at least one machine. Edit ``/etc/default/pulp_workers`` to your liking,
and then enable and start the ``pulp_workers`` service. For Upstart systems::

    $ sudo chkconfig pulp_workers on
    $ sudo service pulp_workers start

For systemd systems::

    $ sudo systemctl enable pulp_workers
    $ sudo systemctl start pulp_workers

.. warning::
   If you distribute Pulp across more than one server either through load balancing the HTTP
   requests, or through running pulp_workers on more than one machine, it is very important that you
   provide ``/var/lib/pulp`` as a shared filesystem to each host that is participating in the Pulp
   installation.

There are two more services that need to be running, but it is very important that only one instance
of each of these runs across the entire Pulp installation.

.. warning::
   ``pulp_celerybeat`` and ``pulp_resource_manager`` must both be singletons, so be sure that
   you only enable each of these on one host. They do not have to run on the same host, however.
   Note that each Pulp child node will also need its own instance of each of these services, as
   a Pulp child node is technically a separate distributed application from its parent.

On the host(s) that will run these two services (they do not have to run on the same host), edit
``/etc/default/pulp_celerybeat`` and ``/etc/default/pulp_resource_manager`` to your liking. Then
enable and start the services. For Upstart::

    $ sudo chkconfig pulp_celerybeat on
    $ sudo service pulp_celerybeat start
    $ sudo chkconfig pulp_resource_manager on
    $ sudo service pulp_resource_manager start

For systemd::

    $ sudo systemctl enable pulp_celerybeat
    $ sudo systemctl start pulp_celerybeat
    $ sudo systemctl enable pulp_resource_manager
    $ sudo systemctl start pulp_resource_manager
