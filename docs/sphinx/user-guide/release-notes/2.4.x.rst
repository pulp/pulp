API Changes
-----------

* Schedule delete no longer returns a 404 when the schedule is not found. It will
  return a 200, because this is exactly the condition the user asked for.

ScheduledCall
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ScheduledCall model has changed substantially.

* ``last_run`` is now ``last_run_at``
* ``args`` and ``kwargs`` are now top-level attributes of the object.
* ``task`` is a new attribute that is the python path to the task this schedule will execute.
* ``resource`` is a new attribute that is a globally-unique identifier for the object
  this task will operate on. It is used internally to query schedules based on a given resource.

CRUD operations on schedules no longer depend on resource locking, so these API
operations will never return a 202 or 409.

Upgrade Instructions for 2.3.x --> 2.4.0
----------------------------------------

To upgrade to the new Pulp release from version 2.3.x, you should begin by using yum to install the
latest RPMs from the Pulp repository and run the database migrations::

    $ sudo yum upgrade
    $ sudo pulp-manage-db

Pulp 2.4.0 comes with some new services that perform distributed tasks using Celery. You can read
about this more in the :ref:`Installation Guide <distributed_workers_installation>`. You will need
to enable Pulp's workers on at least one machine. Edit ``/etc/default/pulp_workers`` to your liking,
and that enable and start the ``pulp_workers`` service. For Upstart systems::

    $ sudo chkconfig pulp_workers on
    $ sudo service pulp_workers start

For systemd systems::

    $ sudo systemctl enable pulp_workers
    $ sudo systemctl start pulp_workers

.. warning::
   If you distribute Pulp across more than one server either through load balancing the HTTP
   requests, or through running pulp_workers on more than one machine, it is very important that you
   provide ``/var/lib/pulp`` as a shared filesystem to each host that is participating in the Pulp
   installation.

There are two more services that need to be running, but it is very important that only one instance
of each of these runs across the entire Pulp installation.

.. warning::
   ``pulp_celerybeat`` and ``pulp_resource_manager`` must both be singletons, so be sure that
   you only enable each of these on one host. They do not have to run on the same host, however.
   Note that each Pulp child node will also need its own instance of each of these services, as
   a Pulp child node is technically a separate distributed application from its parent.

One the host(s) that will run these two services (they do not have to run on the same host), edit
``/etc/default/pulp_celerybeat`` and ``/etc/default/pulp_resource_manager`` to your liking. Then
enable and start the services. For Upstart::

    $ sudo chkconfig pulp_celerybeat on
    $ sudo service pulp_celerybeat start
    $ sudo chkconfig pulp_resource_manager on
    $ sudo service pulp_resource_manager start

For systemd::

    $ sudo systemctl enable pulp_celerybeat
    $ sudo systemctl start pulp_celerybeat
    $ sudo systemctl enable pulp_resource_manager
    $ sudo systemctl start pulp_resource_manager
