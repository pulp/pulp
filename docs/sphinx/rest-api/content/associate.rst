Copying Units Between Repositories
==================================

Pulp provides the ability to copy units between repositories. Units to copy
are specified through a :ref:`unit association criteria <unit_association_criteria>` applied to a
source repository, where only the ``filters`` field applies. All matching units
are imported into the destination repository.

The only restriction is that the destination repository must be configured
with an importer that supports the type of units being copied.

| :method:`post`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<destination_repo_id>/actions/associate/`
| :permission:`update`
| :param_list:`post`

* :param:`source_repo_id,str,repository from which to copy units`
* :param:`?criteria,criteria document,filters which units to copy from the source repository`
* :param:`?override_config,object,importer configuration values that override the importer's default configuration`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`202,if the request was accepted by the server to execute asynchronously`

| :return:`call report representing the current state of the association`

:sample_request:`post` ::

  {
    'source_repo_id' : 'pulp-f17',
    'criteria': {
      'type_ids' : ['rpm'],
      'filters' : {
        'unit' : {
          '$and': [{'name': {'$regex': 'p.*'}}, {'version': {'$gt': '1.0'}}]
        }
      }
    },
   'override_config': {
     'resolve_dependencies: true,
     'recursive': true
    },
  }


Unassociating Content Units from a Repository
=============================================

Pulp also provides the ability to unassociate units from a repository. Units to
unassociate are specified through a :ref:`unit_association_criteria` applied to
the repository. All matching units are unassociated from the repository.

The only restriction is that the content units can only be unassociated by the
same person that originally associated the units with the repository.

| :method:`post`
| :path:`/v2/repositories/<repo_id>/actions/unassociate/`
| :permission:`update`
| :param_list:`post`

* :param:`criteria,criteria document,filters which units to unassociate from the repository`

| :response_list:`_`

* :response_code:`202,if the request was accepted by the server to execute asynchronously`

| :return:`call report representing the current state of the unassociation`
