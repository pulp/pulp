Developer Setup
===============

To ease developer setup, we have `Pulplift <https://github.com/pulp/pulplift>`_ which is based on
the `Forklift <https://github.com/theforeman/forklift>`_ project and utilizes
`Ansible <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html>`_ roles and playbooks to provide supported
`Vagrant <https://docs.vagrantup.com/>`_ boxes that are more consistent with the user experience.

Clone the 'pulplift', 'pulp', 'pulpcore-plugin' and 'pulp_file' (or any plugins that you'll be working on)
repos into the same directory so that they are peers.

Navigate into the pulplift directory. Follow the installation instructions in the
`README.md <https://github.com/pulp/pulplift#setup>`_ which will clone the required forklift and
`'ansible-pulp3' <https://github.com/pulp/ansible-pulp3>`_ repos.

The parent directory of 'pulplift' is going to be mounted into the vagrant box at
/home/vagrant/devel. Any plugins that need to be installed should be added to the
pulplift/ansible-pulp3/source-install.yml playbook. The paths to the source of the plugins should
start with /home/vagrant/devel/. For example::

    pulp_install_plugins:
      pulp-python:
        app_label: "python"
        source_dir: "/home/vagrant/devel/pulp_python"
      pulp-file:
        app_label: "file"
        source_dir: "/home/vagrant/devel/pulp_file"

Once this is complete, take a look at available boxes with 'vagrant status' and then spin up your
chosen environment::

    vagrant up pulp3-source-fedora28

Activate your virtual environment::

    workon pulp

Happy developing!
