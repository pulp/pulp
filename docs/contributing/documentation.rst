Documentation
=============

New features should include documentation.

Pulp's documentation is designed with the following principles:

# Concepts should be introduced in "guides" that are designed to be read linearly.
    # Guides should assume as little knowledge as is reasonable.
    # Guides should avoid documenting external projects, providing links instead wherever
    reasonable.
    # Guides should be considered "introductory", advanced topics should be left out where
    possible, and linked to where relevant.

# Documentation Layout should be designed for users to intuitively be able to find information, and
they should see introductory material before advanced topics.
# Documentation should make heavy use of cross references to limit repitition.
# Any new terms should be defined and linked to the glossary.
# Documentation should make use of language presented in the TODO(link, overview)
# Each document should provide a summary of content and the intended audience. Links to related
documents should be provided and recommended in the summary section.
