Pulp 2.13 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.13.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Log statements which are emitted from task processes now include a short task
  id of 8 characters (i.e. ``pulp.server.sync::INFO: [0ca4399c] ...``) which
  can be used to look up a task.
* Users no longer need to have pulp_celerybeat running to know whether pulp_workers or
  pulp_resource_manager are online. All workers now write their own heartbeat records to the
  database, eliminating the dependence on pulp_celerybeat.

Bug Fixes
---------
