**Acquire, Organize, and Distribute Software**

The Pulp Plugin API provides a set of base classes that can be
implemented in plugins to manage content in a way that is consistent across plugins, while
still allowing plugin writers the freedom to define their workflows as they deem necessary.

Pulp is completely free and open-source!
