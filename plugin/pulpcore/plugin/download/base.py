class BaseDownloader:
    """
    The base class of all downloaders, providing digest calculation, validation, and file handling.

    This is an abstract class and is meant to be subclassed. Subclasses are required to implement
    the :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.run` method and do two things:

        1. Pass all downloaded data to
           :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.handle_data` and schedule it.

        2. Schedule :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.finalize` after all data has
           been delivered to :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.handle_data`.

    Passing all downloaded data the into
    :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.handle_data` allows the file digests to
    be computed while data is written to disk. The digests computed are required if the download is
    to be saved as an :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact` which avoids having to re-read the
    data later.

    The :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.handle_data` method by default
    writes to a random file in the current working directory or you can pass in your own file
    object. See the ``custom_file_object`` keyword argument for more details. Allowing the download
    instantiator to define the file to receive data allows the streamer to receive the data instead
    of having it written to disk.

    The call to :meth:`~pulpcore.plugin.download.BaseDownloader.finalize` ensures that all
    data written to the file-like object is quiesced to disk before the file-like object has
    `close()` called on it.

    Attributes:
        url (str): The url to download.
        expected_digests (dict): Keyed on the algorithm name provided by hashlib and stores the
            value of the expected digest. e.g. {'md5': '912ec803b2ce49e4a541068d495ab570'}
        expected_size (int): The number of bytes the download is expected to have.
        path (str): The full path to the file containing the downloaded data if no
            ``custom_file_object`` option was specified, otherwise None.
