class DeclarativeArtifact:
    """
    Relates an :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact`, how to download it, and its
    `relative_path` used later during publishing.

    This is used by the Stages API stages to determine if an
    :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact` is already present and ensure Pulp can download it in
    the future. The `artifact` can be either saved or unsaved. If unsaved, the `artifact` attributes
    may be incomplete because not all digest information can be computed until the
    :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact` is downloaded.

    Attributes:
        artifact (:class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact`): An
            :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact` either saved or unsaved. If unsaved, it
            may have partial digest information attached to it.
        url (str): the url to fetch the :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact` from.
        relative_path (str): the relative_path this :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact`
            should be published at for any Publication.
        remote (:class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Remote`): The remote used to fetch this
            :class:`~pulpcore.plugin.models.Artifact`.
        extra_data (dict): A dictionary available for additional data to be stored in.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If `artifact`, `url`, `relative_path`, or `remote` are not specified.
