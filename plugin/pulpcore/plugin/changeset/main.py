    A set of changes to be applied to a repository.

    When applied, the following changes are made.

    For each content (unit) added:

    - All content artifacts are downloaded as needed (unless deferred=True).
    - The content (model) is saved.
    - All artifacts (models) are saved.
    - Deferred download catalog entries are created for each artifact.
    - The content (unit) is added to the repository.

    For each content (unit) removed:

    - Content removed from the repository.
    - Deferred download catalog deleted for each artifact.

    Attributes:
        importer (pulpcore.plugin.Importer): An importer.
        additions (SizedIterable): The content to be added to the repository.
        removals (SizedIterable): The content IDs to be removed.
        deferred (bool): Downloading is deferred.  When true, downloads are not performed
            but content is still created and added to the repository.
        added (int): The number of content units successfully added.
        removed (int): The number of content units successfully removed.
        failed (int): The number of changes that failed.
