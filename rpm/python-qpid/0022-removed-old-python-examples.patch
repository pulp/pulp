-Running the Python Examples
-============================
+The Python Examples
+===================
 
+README.txt                 -- This file.
 
-Running the Direct Examples
-----------------------------
+api                        -- Directory containing drain, spout,
+                              sever, hello, and hello_xml examples.
 
-To run the direct examples, do the following:
+api/drain                  -- A simple messaging client that prints
+                              messages from the source specified on
+                              the command line.
 
-1. Make sure that a qpidd broker is running:
+api/spout                  -- A simple messaging client that sends
+                              messages to the target specified on the
+                              command line.
 
- $ ps -eaf | grep qpidd
+api/server                 -- An example server that process incoming
+                              messages and sends replies.
 
-  If a broker is running, you should see the qpidd process in the output of the above command. 
+api/hello                  -- An example client that sends a message
+                              and then receives it.
 
-2.Declare a message queue and bind it to an exchange by running declare_queues.py, as follows:
+api/hello_xml              -- An example client that sends a message
+                              to the xml exchange and then receives
+                              it.
 
- $ python declare_queues.py
 
- This program has no output. After this program has been run, all messages sent to the amq.direct exchange using the routing key routing_key are sent to the queue named message_queue.
+reservations               -- Directory containing an example machine
+                              reservation system.
 
-3.Publish a series of messages to the amq.direct exchange by running direct_producer.py, as follows:
+reservations/common.py     -- Utility code used by reserve,
+                              machine-agent, and inventory scripts.
 
- $ python direct_producer.py
+reservations/reserve       -- Messaging client for listing, reserving,
+                              and releasing machines.
 
-This program has no output; the messages are routed to the message queue, as instructed by the binding.
+reservations/machine-agent -- Messaging server that tracks and reports
+                              on the status of its host machine and
+                              listens for reservation requests.
 
-4. Read the messages from the message queue using direct_consumer.py or listener.py, as follows:
-
- $ python direct_consumer.py
-
- or
-
- $ python listener.py
-
-You should see the following output:
-
-message 0
-message 1
-message 2
-message 3
-message 4
-message 5
-message 6
-message 7
-message 8
-message 9
-That's all, folks!
-
-
-
-Running the Fanout Examples
-----------------------------
-
-To run the programs for the Fanout example, do the following:
-
-1. Make sure that a qpidd broker is running:
-
-  $ ps -eaf | grep qpidd
-
-If a broker is running, you should see the qpidd process in the output of the above command.  
-
-2. In separate windows, start two or more fanout consumers or fanout listeners as follows:
-
-  $ python fanout_consumer.py
-
-  or
-
-  $ python listener.py
-
-These programs each create a private queue, bind it to the amq.fanout exchange, and wait for messages to arrive on their queue.
-
-3. In a separate window, publish a series of messages to the amq.fanout exchange by running fanout_producer.py, as follows:
-
-  $ python fanout_producer.py
-
-This program has no output; the messages are routed to the message queue, as instructed by the binding.
- 
-4. Go to the windows where you are running consumers or listeners. You should see the following output for each listener or consumer:
-
-      message 0
-      message 1
-      message 2
-      message 3
-      message 4
-      message 5
-      message 6
-      message 7
-      message 8
-      message 9
-      That's all, folks!
-
-
-
-Running the Publish-Subscribe Examples
----------------------------------------
-
-To run the programs for the Publish-Subscribe example, do the following:
-
-1. Make sure that a qpidd broker is running:
-
-  $ ps -eaf | grep qpidd
-
-If a broker is running, you should see the qpidd process in the output of the above command. 
-
-2. In separate windows, start one or more topic subscribers by running topic_subscriber.py, as follows:
-
-  $ python topic_subscriber.py
-
-You will see output similar to this:
-
-  Queues created - please start the topic producer
-  Subscribing local queue 'local_news' to news-53408183-fcee-4b92-950b-90abb297e739'
-  Subscribing local queue 'local_weather' to weather-53408183-fcee-4b92-950b-90abb297e739'
-  Subscribing local queue 'local_usa' to usa-53408183-fcee-4b92-950b-90abb297e739'
-  Subscribing local queue 'local_europe' to europe-53408183-fcee-4b92-950b-90abb297e739'
-  Messages on 'news' queue:
-
-Each topic consumer creates a set of private queues, and binds each queue to the amq.topic exchange together with a binding that indicates which messages should be routed to the queue.
-
-3.In another window, start the topic publisher, which publishes messages to the amq.topic exchange, as follows:
-
-  $ python topic_publisher.py
-
-This program has no output; the messages are routed to the message queues for each topic_consumer as specified by the bindings the consumer created.
-
-4. Go back to the window for each topic consumer. You should see output like this:
-
-      Messages on 'news' queue:
-      usa.news 0
-      usa.news 1
-      usa.news 2
-      usa.news 3

-
-Running the Request/Response Examples
---------------------------------------
-
-To run the programs for the Request/Response example, do the following:
-
-1. Make sure that a qpidd broker is running:
-
-  $ ps -eaf | grep qpidd
-
-If a broker is running, you should see the qpidd process in the output of the above command.
-
-2. Run the server.
-
-  $ python server.py
-
-You should see the following output:
-
-  Request server running - run your client now.
-  (Times out after 100 seconds ...)
-
-3. In a separate window, start a client:
-
-  $ python client.py
-
-You should see the following output:
-
-      Request: Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
-      Request: Did gyre and gimble in the wabe.
-      Request: All mimsy were the borogroves,
-      Request: And the mome raths outgrabe.
-      Messages on queue: reply_to:db0f862e-6b36-4e0f-a4b2-ad049eb435ce
-      Response: TWAS BRILLIG, AND THE SLITHY TOVES
-      Response: DID GYRE AND GIMBLE IN THE WABE.
-      Response: ALL MIMSY WERE THE BOROGROVES,
-      Response: AND THE MOME RATHS OUTGRABE.
-      No more messages!
-
-
-Running the XML-based Routing Examples
----------------------------------------
-
-To run the programs for the XML-based Routing example, do the following:
-
-1. Make sure that a qpidd broker is running:
-
-  $ ps -eaf | grep qpidd
-
-If a broker is running, you should see the qpidd process in the output of the above command.
-
-2. Declare an XML exchange and a message queue, then bind the queue to the exchange by running declare_queues.py, as follows:
-
-  $ python declare_queues.py
-
-This program has no output. After this program has been run, all messages sent to the xml exchange using the routing key weather are sent to the queue named message_queue if they satisfy the conditions specified in the following XQuery, which is used in the binding:
-
- let $w := ./weather
- return $w/station = 'Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU)'
-    and $w/temperature_f > 50
-    and $w/temperature_f - $w/dewpoint > 5
-    and $w/wind_speed_mph > 7
-    and $w/wind_speed_mph < 20
-
-3. Publish a series of messages to the xml exchange by running xml_producer.py, as follows:
-
-  $ python xml_producer.py
-
-The messages are routed to the message queue, as prescribed by the binding. Each message represents a weather report, such as this one:
-
-  <weather>
-      <station>Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU)</station>
-      <wind_speed_mph>16</wind_speed_mph>
-      <temperature_f>70</temperature_f>
-      <dewpoint>35</dewpoint>
-  </weather>
-
-4. Read the messages from the message queue using direct_consumer.py or listener.py, as follows:
-
-  $ python xml_consumer.py
-
-  or
-
-  $ python listener.py
-
-You should see the following output:
-
-<weather><station>Raleigh-Durham International Airport (KRDU)</station>
-<wind_speed_mph>16</wind_speed_mph><temperature_f>70</temperature_f>
-<dewpoint>35</dewpoint></weather>
-
-
-Running the Headers Examples
------------------------------
-
-To run the headers examples, do the following:
-
-1. Make sure that a qpidd broker is running:
-
- $ ps -eaf | grep qpidd
-
-  If a broker is running, you should see the qpidd process in the output of the above command. 
-
-2.Declare a message queues and bind them to an exchange by running declare_queues.py, as follows:
-
- $ python declare_queues.py
-
- This program has no output. After this program has been run, all messages sent to the amq.match exchange with an application-header of {'class': 'first'} will be routed to the queue named "first" and messages with an application-header of {'class': 'second'} will be routed to the queue named "second".
-
-3.Publish a series of messages to the amq.match exchange by running headers_producer.py, as follows:
-
- $ python headers_producer.py
-
-This program has no output; the messages are routed to the message queues, as instructed by the bindings.
-
-4. Read the messages from the message queues using headers_consumer.py as follows:
-
- $ python headers_consumer.py
-
-You should see the following output:
-
-message(first) 0
-message(first) 1
-message(first) 2
-message(first) 3
-message(first) 4
-message(first) 5
-message(first) 6
-message(first) 7
-message(first) 8
-message(first) 9
-That's all, folks!
-message(second) 0
-message(second) 1
-message(second) 2
-message(second) 3
-message(second) 4
-message(second) 5
-message(second) 6
-message(second) 7
