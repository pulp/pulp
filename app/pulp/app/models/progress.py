    Shows progress reporting when the count of items is not known.

    Plugin writers should create these objects to show progress reporting of a single step or
    aspect of work which has a name and a state. For example:

        >>> ProgressSpinner(message='Publishing Metadata')  # default state is 'waiting'

        >>> ProgressSpinner(message='Publishing Metadata', state='running')  # specify 'running'

class ProgressBar(ProgressReport):
    """
    Shows progress reporting when the count of items is known.

    Plugin writers should create these objects to show progress reporting of a single step or
    aspect of work which has a name and state along with total and done counts. For example:

        >>> ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23)  # default: state='waiting' and done=0

        >>> ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23, state='running')  # specify the state
        >>> ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23, done=16)  # already completed 16

        >>> progress_bar = ProgressBar('Publishing files', total=23, state='running')
        >>> progress_bar.state = 'completed'
        >>> progress_bar.save()

    The ProgressBar() is a context manager that provides automatic state transitions for the RUNNING
    COMPLETED and ERRORED states. The increment() method can be called in the loop as work is
    completed. Use it as follows:

        >>> progress_bar = ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=len(files_iterator))
        >>> progress_bar.save()
        >>> with progress_bar:
        >>>     # progress_bar now at 'running'
        >>>     for file in files_iterator:
        >>>         handle(file)
        >>>         progress_bar.increment()  # increments and saves
        >>> # progress_bar is at 'completed' if no exception or 'errored' if an exception was raised

    A convenience method called iter() allows you to avoid calling increment() directly:

        >>> progress_bar = ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=len(files_iterator))
        >>> progress_bar.save()
        >>> with progress_bar:
        >>>     for file in progress_bar.iter(files_iterator):
        >>>         handle(file)

    You can also use this short form:

        >>> with ProgressBar.objects.create(
        >>>     message='Publishing files', total=len(files_iterator)) as progress_bar:
        >>>     for file in progress_bar.iter(files_iterator):
        >>>         handle(file)
