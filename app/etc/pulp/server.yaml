# Pulp server configuration
#
# Values shown are the default values used, unless otherwise indicated.


# `allowed_hosts`: A list of strings representing the host/domain names that
# Pulp can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header
# attacks. A value beginning with a period can be used as a sub-domain wildcard.
# The default is the host's FQDN.
#
# allowed_hosts:
#   - pulp.example.com

# `databases`: An associative array (dictionary) of databases to use. For the
# full list of configuration options, refer to the Django database documentation
# shipped with your version of Django, or online at
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#databases
#
# By default, Pulp will attempt to connect to PostgreSQL on a local Unix
# socket using the 'pulp' user with a database name of 'pulp'.
#
# databases:
#   default:
#     CONN_MAX_AGE: 0
#     ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2

#     USER: pulp

# Logging configuration
#
# `logging`: Logging configuration for Pulp. By default, Pulp logs to syslog.
# It is possible to change this by providing a Python logging dictConfig. For
# more information, see Django's logging documentation.
#
# logging:
#   loggers:
#     django:
#       level: INFO
#     pulp.app:
#       level: INFO

# Broker configuration
#
# `broker`: Broker configuration for Pulp. By default, Pulp uses the Qpid
# broker without SSL. It is possible to change this by providing a different
# broker string. The remaining options are used to configure SSL settings.
#
# broker:
#   url: qpid://localhost/
#   celery_require_ssl: false
#   cacert: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/ca.crt
#   keyfile: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt
