# Travis' scripts use unbound variables. This is problematic, because the
# changes made to this script's environment appear to persist when Travis'
# scripts execute. Perhaps this script is sourced by Travis? Regardless of why,
# we need to reset the environment when this script finishes.
#
# We can't use `trap cleanup_function EXIT` or similar, because this script is
# apparently sourced, and such a trap won't execute until the (buggy!) calling
# script finishes.
