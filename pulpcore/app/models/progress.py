            shown to the user. (required)
        state (models.TextField): The state of the progress update. Defaults to `WAITING`. This
            field uses a limited set of choices of field states. See `STATES` for possible states.
        total: (models.IntegerField) The total count of items to be handled by the ProgressBar
            (required)
        done (models.IntegerField): The count of items already processed. Defaults to 0.
        suffix (models.TextField): Customizable suffix rendered with the progress report
            See `the docs <https://github.com/verigak/progress>`_. for more info.

    Shows progress reporting when the count of items is not known.

    Plugin writers should create these objects to show progress reporting of a single step or
    aspect of work which has a name and a state. For example:

        >>> ProgressSpinner(message='Publishing Metadata')  # default state is 'waiting'

        >>> ProgressSpinner(message='Publishing Metadata', state='running')  # specify 'running'

    Update the state to COMPLETED and save it:

    The ProgressSpinner() is a context manager that provides automatic state transitions and saving
    for the RUNNING CANCELED COMPLETED and FAILED states. When ProgressSpinner() is used as a
    context manager progress reporting is rate limited to every 500 milliseconds.
    Use it as follows:

        >>> spinner = ProgressSpinner(message='Publishing Metadata')
        >>> spinner.save() # spinner is saved as 'waiting'
        >>> with spinner:
        >>>     # spinner is saved as 'running'
        >>>     publish_metadata()
        >>> # spinner is saved as 'completed' if no exception is raised or 'failed' otherwise

    You can also use this short form which handles all necessary save() calls:

        >>> with ProgressSpinner(message='Publishing Metadata'):
        >>>     publish_metadata()

    ProgressSpinner objects are associated with a Task and auto-discover and populate the task id
    when saved.

    class Meta:

class ProgressBar(ProgressReport):
    """
    Shows progress reporting when the count of items is known.

    Plugin writers should create these objects to show progress reporting of a single step or
    aspect of work which has a name and state along with total and done counts. For example:

        >>> ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23)  # default: state='waiting' and done=0

        >>> ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23, state='running')  # specify the state
        >>> ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23, done=16)  # already completed 16

    Update the state to COMPLETED and save it:

        >>> progress_bar = ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=23, state='running')
        >>> progress_bar.state = 'completed'
        >>> progress_bar.save()

    The ProgressBar() is a context manager that provides automatic state transitions and saving for
    the RUNNING CANCELED COMPLETED and FAILED states. The increment() method can be called in the
    loop as work is completed. When ProgressBar() is used as a context manager progress reporting
    is rate limited to every 500 milliseconds.
    Use it as follows:

        >>> progress_bar = ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=len(files_iterator))
        >>> progress_bar.save()
        >>> with progress_bar:
        >>>     # progress_bar saved as 'running'

        >>>         handle(file)
        >>>         progress_bar.increment()  # increments and saves
        >>> # progress_bar is saved as 'completed' if no exception or 'failed' otherwise

    A convenience method called iter() allows you to avoid calling increment() directly:

        >>> progress_bar = ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=len(files_iterator))
        >>> progress_bar.save()
        >>> with progress_bar:
        >>>     for file in progress_bar.iter(files_iterator):
        >>>         handle(file)

    You can also use this short form which handles all necessary save() calls:

        >>> with ProgressBar(message='Publishing files', total=len(files_iterator)) as pb:
        >>>     for file in pb.iter(files_iterator):
        >>>         handle(file)

    ProgressBar objects are associated with a Task and auto-discover and populate the task id when
    saved.

    When using threads to update a ProgressBar in parallel, it is recommended that all threads
    share the same in-memory instance. Django does not synchronize in-memory model instances, so
    multiple instances of a specific ProgressBar will diverge as they are written to from separate
    threads.
