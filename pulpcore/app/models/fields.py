    A custom FileField that always saves files to location specified by 'upload_to'.

        Return FieldFile object which specifies path to the file to be stored in database.

        There are two ways to get artifact into Pulp: sync and upload.

        The upload case
         - file is not stored yet, aka file._committed = False
         - nothing to do here in addition to Django pre_save actions

        The sync case:
         - file is already stored in a temporary location, aka file._committed = True
         - it needs to be moved into Pulp artifact storage if it's not there
         - TemporaryDownloadedFile takes care of correctly set storage path
         - only then Django pre_save actions should be performed

        Args:
            model_instance (`class::pulpcore.plugin.Artifact`): The instance this field belongs to.
            add (bool): Whether the instance is being saved to the database for the first time.
                        Ignored by Django pre_save method.

        Returns:
            FieldFile object just before saving.
