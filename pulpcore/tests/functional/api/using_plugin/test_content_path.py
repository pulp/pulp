    Different code paths are used in Pulp for the cases when artifacts are
    already present on the filesystem during sync and when they are not
    downloaded yet

    This test targets the following issue:

    `Pulp #4442 <https://pulp.plan.io/issues/4442>`_

    Does the following:

    1. Assure that no content from repository A is downloaded.
    2. Sync/publish repository A with download policy immediate.
    3. Sync/publish repository A again with download policy immediate.
    4. No failure in 2 shows that sync went fine when content was
       not present on the disk and in the database.
    5. No failure in 3 shows that sync went fine when content was already
       present on the disk and in the database.
