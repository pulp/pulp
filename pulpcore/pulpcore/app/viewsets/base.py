    A customized named ModelViewSet that knows how to register itself with the Pulp API router.

    This viewset is discoverable by its name.
    "Normal" Django Models and Master/Detail models are supported by the ``register_with`` method.

    Attributes:
        lookup_field (str): The name of the field by which an object should be looked up, in
            addition to any parent lookups if this ViewSet is nested. Defaults to 'pk'
        endpoint_name (str): The name of the final path segment that should identify the ViewSet's
            collection endpoint.
        nest_prefix (str): Optional prefix under which this ViewSet should be nested. This must
            correspond to the "parent_prefix" of a router with rest_framework_nested.NestedMixin.
            None indicates this ViewSet should not be nested.
        parent_lookup_kwargs (dict): Optional mapping of key names that would appear in self.kwargs
            to django model filter expressions that can be used with the corresponding value from
            self.kwargs, used only by a nested ViewSet to filter based on the parent object's
            identity.
