# Pulp server configuration
#
# Values shown are the default values used, unless otherwise indicated.

# Django Settings
#
# `allowed_hosts`: A list of strings representing the host/domain names that
# Pulp can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header
# attacks. A value beginning with a period can be used as a sub-domain wildcard.
# The default is the host's FQDN.
#
# allowed_hosts:
#   - pulp.example.com

# `databases`: An associative array (dictionary) of databases to use. For the
# full list of configuration options, refer to the Django database documentation
# shipped with your version of Django, or online at
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/settings/#databases
#
# By default, Pulp will use a sqlite3 database. If your environment is used in production
# consider configuring Postgresql or another Django supported database.
#

  default:
    CONN_MAX_AGE: 0
    ENGINE: django.db.backends.sqlite3

# `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for a particular Django installation. This is used to provide
# cryptographic signing, and should be set to a unique, unpredictable value.

# Logging configuration
#
# `logging`: Logging configuration for Pulp. By default, Pulp logs to syslog. Pulp also support
# a console logger, this can be set by changing logger handlers to "console". It is possible to
# use additional loggers handler by providing a logging dictConfig. For more information,
# see Django's logging documentation.
#
# logging:
#   formatters:
#     simple:
#       format: "pulp: %(name)s:%(levelname)s: %(message)s"
#   handlers:
#     console:
#       class: logging.StreamHandler
#       formatter: simple
#     syslog:
#       address: /dev/log
#       class: logging.handlers.SysLogHandler

#   loggers:
#     '':
#       handlers: ["syslog"]
#       level: INFO

# Broker configuration
#
# `broker`: Broker configuration for Pulp. By default, Pulp uses the RabbitMQ
# broker without SSL. It is possible to change this by providing a different
# broker string. The remaining options are used to configure SSL settings.

#   url: amqp://localhost/
#   celery_require_ssl: False
#   ssl_ca_certificate: /etc/pki/pulp/broker/ca.crt

#   `web_server`: The type of web server.  Must be: (django|apache|nginx).
#                 When set to 'apache', the X-SENDFILE header is injected which delegates
#                 streaming the content to Apache.  Requires: mod_xsendfile to be installed.
#                 When set to 'nginx', the X-Accel-Redirect header is injected which delegates
#                 streaming the content to NGINX.
#   `host`: The host name or IP and an optional port number for the Content App. (e.g.
#           example.com:8000) This value should be specified only if the Content App is served on
#           a host that's different from the REST API. The default value is the same as the host
#           used to serve the REST API.
#
# content:
#   web_server: django
#   host: pulp.example.com
