# Quick Summary:
# To change logging options.
#
# TO ADJUST LOG LEVEL:
# Find the section labeled [logger_<whatever>] that matches the area you are
# interested in. Change the "level:" setting there, and reload the webserver.
#
# When moving to DEBUG level, the appropriate [handler_*] entry below will need
# to be lowered to DEBUG as well. All other levels need only be changed in the
# logger itself.
#
# Look for 'qualname' in a logger_* section
# 'qualname' represents the module name in the python file
# Example:  pulp.server.api.repo_sync would be controlled by
# qualname: pulp.server.api.repo_sync
# as well as 'qualname: pulp.server.api'
#
# If you want to add a new section
# 1) Add an entry to 'keys' under [loggers] for MODULENAME
# 2) Add a new [logger_MODULENAME]
# 3) Add a 'propagate: 0' to [logger_MODULENAME]
#    This will ensure the log messages are handled as you want 
#    and don't reach any higher up loggers
#
# Note:
#  Python 2.4 has an issue with spaces between commas
