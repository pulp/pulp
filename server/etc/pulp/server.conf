# =========================
# Pulp Server Configuration
# =========================

# The settings in this file are all commented by default, and the commented settings show the
# default values that Pulp Server will choose if not specified here.

# -- Common Configuration -----------------------------------------------------

# = Database =
#
# Controls the behavior of MongoDB under Pulp's usage.
#
# Authentication - If the username and the password keys have values provided,
# the pulp server will attempt to authenticate to the MongoDB server.  The
# username and password provided here will be used to authenticate with the
# database specified in the name field.
#
# Replica Sets - If more than one seed is provided, a connection will be attempted to each seed
# until a connection is made. When multiple seeds are provided, the 'replica_set' value must also
# be specified.
#
# name:              name of the database to use
# seeds:             comma-separated list of hostname:port of database replica seed hosts
# username:          The user name to use for authenticating to the MongoDB server
# password:          The password to use for authenticating to the MongoDB server
# replica_set:       uncomment and set this value to the name of replica set configured in MongoDB,
#                    if one is in use
# ssl:               If True, create the connection to the server using SSL.
# ssl_keyfile:       A path to the private keyfile used to identify the local connection against
#                    mongod. If included with the certfile then only the ssl_certfile is needed.
# ssl_certfile:      The certificate file used to identify the local connection against mongod.
# verify_ssl:        Specifies whether a certificate is required from the other side of the
#                    connection, and whether it will be validated if provided. If it is true, then
#                    the ssl_ca_certs parameter must point to a file of CA certificates used to
#                    validate the connection.
# ca_path:           The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated “certification authority”
#                    certificates, which are used to validate certificates passed from the other end
#                    of the connection.
# unsafe_autoretry:  If true, retry commands to the database if there is a connection error.
#                    Warning: if set to true, this setting can result in duplicate records.
# write_concern:     Write concern of 'majority' or 'all'. When 'all' is specified, 'w' is set to
#                    number of seeds specified. For version of MongoDB < 2.6, replica_set must also
#                    be specified. Please note that 'all' will cause Pulp to halt if any of the
#                    replica set members is not available. 'majority' is used by default.

# = Server =
#
# Controls general Pulp web server behavior.
#
# server_name:      hostname the admin client and consumers should use when accessing
#                   the server; if not specified, this defaults to the server's fully qualified

# = Security =
#
# Controls aspects of the Pulp web server security.
#
# For production installations, it is recommended that a new CA certificate be
# generated for the signing of user and consumer certificates and configured
# using the following properties.
#
# cacert: full path to the CA certificate that will be used to sign consumer
#     and admin identification certificates; this must match the value of
#     SSLCACertificateFile in /etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp.conf
#     Deprecated! - Please note that both cacert and cakey settings will be
#     removed in the next major release since Pulp will not sign certificates.
#     However, Pulp will continue to support client certificates generated
#     by users through Apache and pulp-admin.
#
# cakey: path to the private key for the above CA certificate
#
# ssl_ca_certificate: full path to the CA certificate used to sign the Pulp
#     server's SSL certificate; consumers will use this to verify the
#     Pulp server's SSL certificate during the SSL handshake
#     Deprecated! - Please note that this setting will be removed in the next
#     major release and will be replaced by a setting in the consumer.conf file
#     that will allow the user to specify a directory path containing certificates.
#
# user_cert_expiration: number of days a user certificate is valid
#
# consumer_cert_expiration: number of days a consumer certificate is valid
#

[security]

# Uncomment the below section with appropriate values to use an external LDAP
# server for user authentication.
#
# enabled: boolean; controls whether or not LDAP authentication is enabled
#
# uri: url of LDAP server
#
# base: location in the directory from which the LDAP search begins
#
# tls: boolean; controls whether or not to use TLS security
#
# default_role: Id of the role to assign LDAP users to by default. This is
#     optional. This role must first be created on the Pulp server. If
#     default_role is not set or doesn't exist, LDAP users are given same
#     default permissions as local users.
#
# filter: directive to set more restrictive LDAP filter to limit the LDAP
#     users who can authenticate to Pulp

# Deprecated! Please use apache's mod_authnz_ldap to do preauthentication. See
# pulp's user guide for details.
# [ldap]
# enabled: true # are you sure? This has been deprecated.
# uri: ldap://localhost
# base: dc=localhost
# tls: no
# default_role: <role-id>

# = Messaging =
#
# Controls Pulp's configuration of broker settings for communicating to the Consumer Agent.
#
# url: the url used to contact the broker. This setting uses the form:
#
#         <protocol>://<host>:<port>/<virtual-host>
#
#     Or to use a username and password:
#
#         <protocol>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<virtual-host>
#
#     Supported <protocol>  values are 'tcp' or 'ssl' depending on if SSL should be used or not.
#     The <virtual-host> is optional, and is only applicable to RabbitMQ broker environments.
#
#     The default broker string is 'tcp://localhost:5672'.
#
# transport: The type of broker you are connecting to. The default is 'qpid'. For RabbitMQ,
#     'rabbitmq' should be used.
#
# cacert: Absolute path to PEM encoded CA certificate file, used by Pulp to validate the identity
#     of the broker using SSL. The default is '/etc/pki/qpid/ca/ca.crt'.
#
# clientcert: Absolute path to PEM encoded file containing both the private key and
#     certificate Pulp should present to the broker to be authenticated by the broker. The default
#     is '/etc/pki/qpid/client/client.pem'.
#
# auth_enabled:
#     Message authentication enabled flag. The default is 'true' which enables authentication.
#     To disable authentication, use 'false'.
#
# topic_exchange: The name of the exchange to use. The exchange must be a topic exchange. The
#     default is 'amq.topic', which is a default exchange that is guaranteed to exist on a Qpid
#     broker. This setting is a string, and therefore includes the single quotes.
#
# event_notifications_enabled:
#     Enables or disables Pulp event notfications on the message bus. Defaults to 'false'.
#
# event_notification_url:
#     The AMQP URL for event notifications. Defaults to 'qpid://localhost:5672/'.

[messaging]
# url: tcp://localhost:5672
# transport: qpid
# auth_enabled: true
# cacert: /etc/pki/qpid/ca/ca.crt
# clientcert: /etc/pki/qpid/client/client.pem
# topic_exchange: 'amq.topic'
# event_notifications_enabled: false
# event_notification_url: qpid://localhost:5672/


# = Asynchronous Tasks =
#
# Controls Pulp's Celery settings. These settings are used by the Pulp Server and Pulp Workers to
# perform asynchronous, server-side task work such as syncing, publishing, or deletion of content.
# Communication between these different components occurs through the broker.
#
# broker_url: A URL to a broker that Celery can use to queue tasks. For example, to configure
#     Celery with a Qpid backend, set broker_url to:
#
#         qpid://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/
#
#     For RabbitMQ you can use the following broker_url style:
#
#         amqp://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<vhost>
#
# celery_require_ssl: Require SSL if set to 'true', otherwise do not require SSL. The default is
#     'false'.
#
# cacert: The absolute path to the PEM encoded CA Certificate allowing identity validation of the
#     message bus. The default is '/etc/pki/pulp/qpid/ca.crt'.
#
# keyfile: The absolute path to the keyfile used for authentication to the message bus. This is the
#     private key that corresponds with the certificate. The default value is
#     '/etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt'. Sometimes the key is kept in the same file as the
#     certificate it corresponds with, and the default assumes this is the case.
#
# certfile: The absolute path to the PEM encoded certificate used for authentication to the message
#     bus. The default value is '/etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt'.
#
# login_method: Select the SASL login method used to connect to the broker. This should be left
#     unset except in special cases such as SSL client certificate authentication.
#
# worker_timeout: The amount of time (in seconds) before considering a worker as missing. If Pulp's
#     mongo database has slow I/O, then setting a higher number may resolve issues where workers are
#     going missing incorrectly. Defaults to 30.

[tasks]
# broker_url: qpid://localhost/
# celery_require_ssl: false
# cacert: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/ca.crt
# keyfile: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt
# certfile: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt
# login_method:
# worker_timeout: 30


# = Email =
#
# Settings that allow the system to send email. It is recommended that
# the system relay through a local MTA on the machine. Pulp does not retry in
# case of error, so it is important to have a real MTA available locally.
#
# If there is a need to test email sending, it is recommended to run this:
#   $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
# which will write each message to stdout.
#
# host: host name of the MTA pulp should relay through
#
# port: destination port to connect on
#
# from: the "From" address of each email the system sends
#
# enabled: boolean controls whether or not emails will be sent

[email]
# host: localhost
# port: 25
# from: no-reply@your.domain
# enabled: false


# = Lazy =
#
# Settings for lazy content loading.
#
# redirect_host:
#   The host FQDN or IP to which requests are redirected. Defaults to
#   the host specified in the original request.
#
# redirect_port:
#   The TCP port to which requests are redirected. By default no port
#   is stated explicitly so an HTTP redirect will use port 80 and an
#   HTTPS redirect will use port 443. The protocol used will match the
#   protocol the client used for the initial request.
#
# redirect_path:
#   The base path to which requests are redirected. Defaults to /streamer/
#
# https_retrieval:
#   boolean; controls whether Pulp uses HTTPS or HTTP to
#   retrieve content from the streamer.
#   WARNING: Setting this to 'false' is not safe if you wish
#            to use Pulp to provide repository entitlement
#            enforcement. It is strongly recommended to keep
#            this set to 'true' and use certificates that are
#            signed by a trusted authority on the web server
#            that serves as the streamer reverse proxy.
#
# download_interval:
#   The interval in minutes between checks for content cached
#   by the Squid proxy.
#
# download_concurrency:
#   The number of downloads to perform concurrently when
#   downloading content from the Squid cache.

[lazy]
# redirect_host:
# redirect_port:
# redirect_path:
# https_retrieval: true
# download_interval: 30
# download_concurrency: 5

# = Profiling =
#
# Settings for profiling Pulp tasks
#
# enabled:
#   This enables the cProfile Python module to profile individual tasks and
#   store the output by task ID in a directory. Note that enabling this can
#   impact performance.
#
# directory:
#   The directory that the cProfiles are written to. This directory must be
#   writeable and readable by Pulp. This directory will be created automatically
#   if it does not exist.

[profiling]
# enabled: false
# directory: /var/lib/pulp/c_profiles
