# seeds: comma-separated list of hostname:port of database replica seed hosts
# operation_retries: number of retries on database operations to
#     perform before giving up and reporting an error

#
# server_name: hostname the admin client and consumers should use when accessing
#     the server; if not specified, this is defaulted to the server's hostname

# = Security =

# generated for the signing of user and consumer certificates and configured
# using the following properties.

#     users who can authenticate to Pulp

# [ldap]
# enabled: true

# topic_exchange: name of the exchange to use; must be a topic exchange;
#     defaults to "amq.topic", which is a default exchange that
#     is guaranteed to exist on the broker
#
# The format for the following timeouts is <start>:<duration>. The <start>
# timeout is the time to wait for the consumer to acknowledge and
# begin handling the request before indicating a timeout has occurred. The
# <duration> timeout is how long the consumer is allowed to act on the request
# before the server considers the entire request timed out.  The default unit is
# seconds.  The numeric value may be specified with an optional unit suffix.
# Supported suffixes are: s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours, d=days.

# = Email =
#
# Settings that allow the system to send email. It is recommended that
# the system relay through a local MTA on the machine. Pulp does not retry in
# case of error, so it is important to have a real MTA available locally.
#
# If there is a need to test email sending, it is recommended to run this:
#   $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
# which will write each message to stdout.
#

#
# port: destination port to connect on
