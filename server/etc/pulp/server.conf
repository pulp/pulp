# =========================
# Pulp Server Configuration
# =========================

# The settings in this file are all commented by default, and the commented settings show the
# default values that Pulp Server will choose if not specified here.

# -- Common Configuration -----------------------------------------------------

# = Database =
#
# Controls the behavior of MongoDB under Pulp's usage.
#
# Authentication - If the username and the password keys have values provided,
# the pulp server will attempt to authenticate to the MongoDB server.  The
# username and password provided here will be used to authenticate with the
# database specified in the name field.
#
# name:              name of the database to use
# seeds:             comma-separated list of hostname:port of database replica seed hosts
# username:          The user name to use for authenticating to the MongoDB server
# password:          The password to use for authenticating to the MongoDB server
# replica_set:       uncomment and set this value to the name of replica set configured in MongoDB,
#                    if one is in use
# ssl:               If True, create the connection to the server using SSL.
# ssl_keyfile:       A path to the private keyfile used to identify the local connection against
#                    mongod. If included with the certfile then only the ssl_certfile is needed.
# ssl_certfile:      The certificate file used to identify the local connection against mongod.
# verify_ssl:        Specifies whether a certificate is required from the other side of the
#                    connection, and whether it will be validated if provided. If it is true, then
#                    the ssl_ca_certs parameter must point to a file of CA certificates used to
#                    validate the connection.
# ca_path:           The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated “certification authority”
#                    certificates, which are used to validate certificates passed from the other end
#                    of the connection.

# = Server =
#
# Controls general Pulp web server behavior.
#
# server_name:      hostname the admin client and consumers should use when accessing
#                   the server; if not specified, this is defaulted to the server's hostname

#                   the first time the server is started
# default_password: default password for admin when it is first created; this
#                   should be changed once the server is operational
# debugging_mode:   boolean; toggles Pulp's debugging capabilities
# log_level:        The desired logging level. Options are: CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG,
#                   and NOTSET. Pulp will default to INFO.

# = Security =
#
# Controls aspects of the Pulp web server security.
#
# For production installations, it is recommended that a new CA certificate be
# generated for the signing of user and consumer certificates and configured
# using the following properties.
#
# cacert: full path to the CA certificate that will be used to sign consumer
#     and admin identification certificates; this must match the value of
#     SSLCACertificateFile in /etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp.conf
#
# cakey: path to the private key for the above CA certificate
#
# ssl_ca_certificate: full path to the CA certificate used to sign the Pulp
#     server's SSL certificate; consumers will use this to verify the
#     Pulp server's SSL certificate during the SSL handshake

#
# consumer_cert_expiration: number of days a consumer certificate is valid
#

# -- Advanced Configuration ---------------------------------------------------

#     than this will be purged; set to -1 to disable

[consumer_history]

# server for user authentication.
#
# enabled: boolean; controls whether or not LDAP authentication is enabled
#
# uri: url of LDAP server
#
# base: location in the directory from which the LDAP search begins
#
# tls: boolean; controls whether or not to use TLS security
#
# default_role: Id of the role to assign LDAP users to by default. This is
#     optional. This role must first be created on the Pulp server. If
#     default_role is not set or doesn't exist, LDAP users are given same
#     default permissions as local users.
#
# filter: directive to set more restrictive LDAP filter to limit the LDAP
#     users who can authenticate to Pulp

# Deprecated! Please use apache's mod_authnz_ldap to do preauthentication. See
# pulp's user guide for details.
# [ldap]
# enabled: true # are you sure? This has been deprecated.
# uri: ldap://localhost
# base: dc=localhost
# tls: no
# default_role: <role-id>
# filter: (gidNumber=200)


# = OAuth =
#
# Uncomment the below section with appropriate values to use OAuth
# authentication.
#
# enabled: boolean; controls whether OAuth authentication is enabled
#

# enabled: true
# oauth_key:
# oauth_secret:


# = Messaging =
#
# Controls Pulp's configuration of broker settings for communicating to the Consumer Agent.
#
# url: the url used to contact the broker. This setting uses the form:
#
#         <protocol>://<host>:<port>/<virtual-host>
#
#     Or to use a username and password:
#
#         <protocol>://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<virtual-host>
#
#     Supported <protocol>  values are 'tcp' or 'ssl' depending on if SSL should be used or not.
#     The <virtual-host> is optional, and is only applicable to RabbitMQ broker environments.
#
#     The default broker string is 'tcp://localhost:5672'.
#
# transport: The type of broker you are connecting to. The default is 'qpid'. For RabbitMQ,
#     'rabbitmq' should be used.
#
# cacert: Absolute path to PEM encoded CA certificate file, used by Pulp to validate the identity
#     of the broker using SSL. The default is '/etc/pki/qpid/ca/ca.crt'.
#
# clientcert: Absolute path to PEM encoded file containing both the private key and
#     certificate Pulp should present to the broker to be authenticated by the broker. The default
#     is '/etc/pki/qpid/client/client.pem'.
#
# auth_enabled:
#     Message authentication enabled flag. The default is 'true' which enables authentication.
#     To disable authentication, use 'false'.
#
# topic_exchange: The name of the exchange to use. The exchange must be a topic exchange. The
#     default is 'amq.topic', which is a default exchange that is guaranteed to exist on a Qpid
#     broker. This setting is a string, and therefore includes the single quotes.
#

[messaging]
# url: tcp://localhost:5672
# transport: qpid
# auth_enabled: true
# cacert: /etc/pki/qpid/ca/ca.crt
# clientcert: /etc/pki/qpid/client/client.pem
# topic_exchange: 'amq.topic'


# = Asynchronous Tasks =
#
# Controls Pulp's Celery settings. These settings are used by the Pulp Server and Pulp Workers to
# perform asynchronous, server-side task work such as syncing, publishing, or deletion of content.
# Communication between these different components occurs through the broker.
#
# broker_url: A URL to a broker that Celery can use to queue tasks. For example, to configure
#     Celery with a Qpid backend, set broker_url to:
#
#         qpid://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/
#
#     For RabbitMQ you can use the following broker_url style:
#
#         amqp://<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<port>/<vhost>
#
# celery_require_ssl: Require SSL if set to 'true', otherwise do not require SSL. The default is
#     'false'.
#
# cacert: The absolute path to the PEM encoded CA Certificate allowing identity validation of the
#     message bus. The default is '/etc/pki/pulp/qpid/ca.crt'.
#
# keyfile: The absolute path to the keyfile used for authentication to the message bus. This is the
#     private key that corresponds with the certificate. The default value is
#     '/etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt'. Sometimes the key is kept in the same file as the
#     certificate it corresponds with, and the default assumes this is the case.
#
# certfile: The absolute path to the PEM encoded certificate used for authentication to the message
#     bus. The default value is '/etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt'.
#

[tasks]
# broker_url: qpid://guest@localhost/
# celery_require_ssl: false
# cacert: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/ca.crt
# keyfile: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt
# certfile: /etc/pki/pulp/qpid/client.crt


# = Email =
#
# Settings that allow the system to send email. It is recommended that
# the system relay through a local MTA on the machine. Pulp does not retry in
# case of error, so it is important to have a real MTA available locally.
#
# If there is a need to test email sending, it is recommended to run this:
#   $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
# which will write each message to stdout.
#
# host: host name of the MTA pulp should relay through
#
# port: destination port to connect on
#
# from: the "From" address of each email the system sends
#
# enabled: boolean controls whether or not emails will be sent

[email]
# host: localhost
# port: 25
# from: no-reply@your.domain
# enabled: false
