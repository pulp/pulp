# Authentication
#
# If you want to authenticate against an external source, the best approach is
# to use an apache authentication plugin. Only use your auth mechanism for the
# login call, and then use pulp's certificate-based auth for successive calls.
#
# You are responsible for ensuring that a user gets created in pulp prior to
# any login attempt. Pulp does not support auto-creation of users that exist in
# your external source.
#
# Below is a "basic" example that works for demos, but a stronger mechanism is
# recommended. The .htaccess file must be created using the "htpasswd" command.

#<Location /pulp/api/v2/actions/login>
#    AuthType Basic
#    AuthName "Pulp Login"
#    AuthUserFile /var/lib/pulp/.htaccess
#    Require valid-user
