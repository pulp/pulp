"""
Due to our factory, we cannot put the instantiation of the Celery application into our app.py
module, as it will lead to circular dependencies since tasks.py also need to import this object, and
the factory ends up importing tasks.py when it imports all the managers.

Hopefully we will eliminate the factory in the future, but until then this workaround is necessary.
