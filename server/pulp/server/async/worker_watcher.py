"""
A module designed to handle celery events related to workers.

Two celery events that need processing are the 'worker-heartbeat' and 'worker-offline'
events. Each 'worker-heartbeat' event is passed to handle_worker_heartbeat() as an event for
handling. Each 'worker-offline' event is passed to handle_worker_offline() for handling.
See the individual function docblocks for more detail on how each event type is handled.

The use of an 'event' or 'celery event' throughout this module refers to a dict built by celery
that contains event information. Read more about this in the docs for celery.events.

Other functions in this module are helper functions designed to deduplicate the amount of shared
code between the event handlers.

    Parse and return the event information we are interested in. Also log it.

    A new dict is returned containing the keys 'timestamp', 'local_received', 'type', and
    'worker_name'. The data transformations here are on the timestamp and local_received. They
    both arrive as seconds since the epoch, and are converted to a naive datetime.datetime object in
    UTC. The timestamp is set by the sender, and the local_received time is set by the receiver.
    Beware of a bug in the value of the timestamp as of the time of this commit as it suffers from
    issues in localities that use daylight savings time during the non-daylight savings time part of
    the year. See https://github.com/celery/celery/issues/1802#issuecomment-161916587 for discussion
    around this issue. Until that issue is resolved, consider using the local_received time instead
    of the timestamp.

    Logging is done through a call to _log_event().
