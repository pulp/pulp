    Adds pulp heartbeat updating to celery workers.

    This class is a celery "Blueprint". It extends the functionality of the celery
    worker by establishing a timer on consumer startup which calls the '_record_heartbeat()'
    method periodically. This allows each worker to write its own worker record to the
    database, instead of relying on pulp_celerybeat to do so.

    This function performs all the necessary initialization of the Celery worker.

    We clean up old state in case this worker was previously running, but died unexpectedly.
    In such cases, any Pulp tasks that were running or waiting on this worker will show incorrect
    state. Any reserved_resource reservations associated with the previous worker will also be
    removed along with the worker entry in the database itself. The working directory specified in
    /etc/pulp/server.conf (/var/cache/pulp/<worker_name>) by default is removed and recreated. This
    is called early in the worker start process, and later when it's fully online, pulp_celerybeat
    will discover the worker as usual to allow new work to arrive at this worker. If there is no
    previous work to cleanup, this method still runs, but has no effect on the database.

    After cleaning up old state, it ensures the existence of the worker's working directory.

    Lastly, this function makes the call to Pulp's initialization code.

    It uses the celeryd_after_setup signal[0] so that it gets called by Celery after logging is
    initialized, but before Celery starts to run tasks.

    If the worker is a resource manager, it tries to acquire a lock stored within the database.
    If the lock cannot be acquired immediately, it will wait until the currently active instance
    becomes unavailable, at which point the worker cleanup routine will clear the lock for us to
    acquire. While the worker remains in this waiting state, it is not connected to the broker and
    will not attempt to do any work. A side effect of this is that, if terminated while in this
    state, the process will not send the "worker-offline" signal used by the EventMonitor to
    immediately clean up terminated workers. Therefore, we override the SIGTERM signal handler
    while in this state so that cleanup is done properly.
