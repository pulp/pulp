    This class is meant to be subclassed by views that need to provide search functionality on a
    Pulp model. In most cases, it should be possible for the subclasses to define only a few class
    variables. Subclasses must define at least one of these two class attributes:

    0) If the SearchView is for searching a MongoEngine model, model should be defined.
    1) If it's for an "old-style" model, manager must be defined.

    :cvar    response_builder: The function that should be used to turn the search results
                               into a JSON serialized Django Response object. If not defined,

                               should represent an instance of the Model's manager class,
                               which must have a find_by_criteria() method.

                               attribute defined with the 'queryset_class' key indexing
