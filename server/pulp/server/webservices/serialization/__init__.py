"""
Serialization package to transform Pulp's persistent resources from the database
representation to a representation compatible with REST.

This package supplies sub-modules, one per database collection. Each module
supplies a number of methods to transform output for consumption by a REST
client. The sub-modules are imported directly into this package to avoid
namespace collisions. A developer only needs to import this package to use all
the serialization modules.

For example:

from pulp.server.webservices import serialization
repo_repr = serialization.repo.serialize(repo)
"""

import binding
import content
import dispatch
import error
import link
import consumer
import db

__all__ = ['binding', 'content', 'dispatch', 'error', 'link', 'consumer', 'db']
