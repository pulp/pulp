Contains knowledge about notifiers in the server as well as the ability to
retrieve the appropriate method needed to handle an event.

Currently this implementation assumes a hardcoded set of notifiers in the server.
Eventually this will likely change to dynamically load notifiers (yet another
plugin point for Pulp) but for current (Jun 21, 2012) needs this is fine.
