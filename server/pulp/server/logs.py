    RFC 5426[0] recommends that we limit the length of our log messages. RFC 3164[1] requires that
    we only include visible characters and spaces in our log messages. Though RFC 3164 is obsoleted
    by 5424[2], Pulp wishes to support older syslog receivers that do not handle newline characters
    gracefully. The tracebacks that Pulp generates can cause problems both due to their length and
    their newlines. This log handler will split messages into multiple messages by newline
    characters (since newline characters aren't handled well) and further by message length. RFC
    5426 doesn't make any specific demands about message length but it appears that our
    target operating systems allow approximately 2041 characters, so we will split there. RFC 5424
    requires that all strings be encoded with UTF-8. Therefore, this
    log handler only accepts unicode strings, or UTF-8 encoded strings.
