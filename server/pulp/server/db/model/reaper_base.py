    By default, MongoDB uses a primary key that has the date that each document was created encoded
    into it. This method generates a pulp.server.compat.ObjectId that corresponds to the timstamp of
    now minus age, where age is a timedelta. For example, if age is 60 seconds, this will
    return an ObjectId that has the UTC time that it was 60 seconds ago encoded into it. This is
    useful in this module, as we want to automatically delete documents that are older than a
    particular age, and so we can issue a remove query to MongoDB for objects with _id attributes
    that are less than the ObjectId returned by this method.
