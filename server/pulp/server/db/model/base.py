    Model base class

    Derived model classes are the representation of persistent data used by
    pulp and are abstractions of the documents used by mongodb. These classes
    are used to create new documents to be stored in a document collection.

    The model base class is derived from the builtin dictionary, and should be
    used as such by code after instantiation. It provides a mechanism to use
    dot notation instead of the usual dictionary key lookup. However, this is
    provided for convenience when declaring fields in the constructors, and
    should not be used by code. Documents that are retrieved from a document
    collection are also derivatives of dictionaries, but are not derivatives
    of the Model class. To ensure interchangeability, make sure to use python's
    regular dictionary key lookup when using Model instances.
    """

    # The model class will know how to fetch the document collection used to
    # store the models in database. If you want a document collection to be
    # associated with your model, all you need to do is define the name of the
    # document collection with the 'collection_name' class field.
    # Once you have defined the collection_name, you may use the
    # 'unique_indices' and 'search_indices' to define which fields are indexed
    # in the document collection.
    # The unique_indices field is a tuple whose elements can be either:
    # * A string name of a model field whose value is to be indexed and must be
    #   unique among all stored instances of the model.
    # * A tuple of string names of model fields that will each be indexed and,
    #   together, must be a unique set of fields among all stored instances of
    #   the model.
    # The search_indices field is only a tuple listing other model fields to be
    # indexed in the collection, but that do not need to be individually unique
    # or form unique sets of values.
