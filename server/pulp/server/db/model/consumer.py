class UnitProfile(Model):
    """
    Represents a consumer profile, which is a data structure that records which content is installed
    on a particular consumer for a particular type.

    Due to the nature of the data conversion used to generate a profile's hash, it is impossible for
    Pulp to know if the ordering of list structures found in the profile are significant or
    not. Therefore, the hash of a list must assume that the ordering of the list is significant. The
    SON objects that Pulp stores in the database cannot contain Python sets.

    It is up to the plugin Profilers to handle this limitation if they wish to store lists in
    the database in such a way that the order shouldn't matter for hash comparison purposes. In
    these cases, the Profiler must order the list in some repeatable manner, so that any two
    profiles that it wants the platform to consider as being the same will have exactly the same
    ordering to those lists.

    For example, the RPM profile contains a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains
    information about RPMs stored on a consumer. The order of the list is not important for the
    purpose of determining what is installed on the system - it might as well be a set. However,
    since a set cannot be stored in MongoDB, it is up to the RPM Profiler to sort the list of
    installed RPMs in some repeatable fashion, such that any two consumers that have exactly the
    same RPMs installed will end up with the same ordering of their RPMs in the database.
