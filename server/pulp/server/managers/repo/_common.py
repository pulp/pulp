Working directories are used as staging or temporary file storage by importers and distributors.
Now that this work is performed inside of celery tasks, each celery worker gets a working
directory. Each task executed by a worker is able to get a working directory inside the workers
root working directory.

The root of the working directories is specified with 'working_directory' setting in
/etc/pulp/server.conf.  The default value is /var/cache/pulp
