        * Initializing the unit through the conduit which populates the final

        from the uploaded unit file. In still others, it may be extraneous
        user-specified information that should be merged in with any derived
        unit metadata.

        Depending on the unit type, it is possible that this call will create

        This call has two options for handling the requested units:

           in mind that the unit key must change in order for the unit to
           be considered different than the supplied one.

        The APIs for both approaches are similar to those in the sync conduit.

        and save_unit simply called on each specified unit.

        The units argument is optional. If None, all units in the source
