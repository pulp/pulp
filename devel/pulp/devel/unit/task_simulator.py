"""
Contains functionality to simulate returning tasks that change state at each invocation. This
should be used for any command that uses asynchronous REST APIs to reduce the need for each
test to create the proper task format.

A TaskSimulator instance is configured with the task information being simulated by
the server. For each task, an ordered list of states can be supplied. Each request to
the server for retrieving the task removes the appropriate state from the configuration;
simulations should be recreated between tests as the running of the task retrieval
will destroy the test data.

The install method on the object can be used to insert it into the correct location in the
bindings object.
