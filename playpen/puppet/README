The puppet module contained in this directory can be used to prepare a fedora 18 or Fedora 19 server
for use in testing pulp.  This module only installs the prerequisites you will still have to install pulp
separately.

Instructions:
1.  Install puppet: yum install puppet
2.  Install the puppet standard libraries: puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib
3.  Apply this module: puppet apply pulp.pp
    This command may have to be run more than once to get everything to apply successfully.
4.  Restart the server so that the changes to disable selinux will take effect.
