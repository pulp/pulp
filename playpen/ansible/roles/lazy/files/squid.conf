 #  * no-query: Disable ICP queries to the Pulp Streamer.
 #
 #  * originserver: Causes the Pulp Streamer to be contacted as the origin

 # Set the location and size of the disk cache.
 # Format is: cache_dir type Directory-Name Fs-specific-data [options]
 #
 # * type specifies the type of storage system to use.
 #
 # * Directory-Name is the top-level directory where cache swap files will be
 #   stored. Squid will not create this directory so it must exist and be 
 #   writable by the Squid process.
 #
 # * Fs-specific-config varies by storage system type. For 'aufs' and 'ufs' 
 #   the data is in the format: Mbytes L1 L2.
 #     - Mbytes is the number of megabytes to use in this cache directory. Note that
 #       that this should never exceed 80% of the storage space in that directory. 
 #     - L1 is the number of first-level subdirectories which are created under
 #       the root cache directory (Directory-Name).
 #     - L2 is the number of second-level subdirectories which will be created under
 #       each L1 subdirectory.
 #
 # Be aware that this directive must NOT precede the 'workers' configuration option,
 # if you choose to use it, and should use configuration macros or conditionals to
 # give each squid worker that requires a disk cache a dedicated cache directory.
 #
 # 'aufs' uses layered directories to store files, utilizing POSIX-threads to 
 #  avoid blocking the main Squid process on disk-I/O. This was formerly known in
 #  Squid as async-io.
 #
 # 'ufs' is simple to set up and available in all recent version of Squid, but
 # should not be used in a production environment. 'ufs' does not make use of
 # threads for I/O, so it blocks when reading from or writing to the cache.
 #
 # 'rock' uses a database-style storage. All cached entries are stored in a
 # 'database' file, using fixed-size slots. A single entry occupies one or 
 # more slots. 'rock' performs best with small files, whereas 'aufs' works best
 # with larger files. A combination of the two can be used in advanced deployments.
