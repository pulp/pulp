Welcome to the Pulp dev environment!

Here are some tips:
* Your code is all checked out inside of ~/devel/.

* The default username:password is admin:admin. When your session expires, you
  can log in again with pulp-admin login -u admin

* You can type workon <project> to quickly cd to a project dir and activate its
  virtualenv. For example:

    $ workon pulp_python

  Similarly, run "workon pulp" to jump into the pulp platform virtualenv.

* Each project has a "run-tests.py" to run the unit tests.

* There are a set of bash functions in your .bashrc that are useful.

  Run 'phelp' to list the available functions and what they do.

* phttp is an alias that gives you authenticated access to the rest API using httpie:

    phttp https://localhost/pulp/api/v2/repositories/zoo/

* You can ssh into your vagrant environment with vagrant ssh, but presumably
  you already know this since you are reading this message :)

More information can be found at
https://pulp.readthedocs.org/en/latest/dev-guide/ and you can ask questions in
#pulp on Freenode IRC.

Happy hacking, and thanks for your contribution!
