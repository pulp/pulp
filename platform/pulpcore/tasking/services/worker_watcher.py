"""
A module designed to handle celery events related to workers.

Two celery events that need processing are the 'worker-heartbeat' and 'worker-offline'
events. Each 'worker-heartbeat' event is passed to handle_worker_heartbeat() as an event for
handling. Each 'worker-offline' event is passed to handle_worker_offline() for handling.
See the individual function docblocks for more detail on how each event type is handled.

The use of an 'event' or 'celery event' throughout this module refers to a dict built by celery
that contains event information. Read more about this in the docs for celery.events.

Other functions in this module are helper functions designed to deduplicate the amount of shared
code between the event handlers.
