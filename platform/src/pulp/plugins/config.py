"""
There are two locations plugin configuration can come from.
* Importer Configuration - the plugin-level configuration found in the config
  files provided for the plugin; this will be the same for all instances of
  the same plugin type
* Repository Configuration - the individual configuration of the plugin for a
  given repository; this is custom and used to dictate how the plugin should
  function when working with an individual repository

The Pulp server provides special handling for the repository configuration. Pulp
will track a static configuration for a plugin associated with a given repository.
This configuration is what is verified by the plugin through the
validate_config call.

For many calls, the Pulp server will allow users to override repo config values
for an individual call. These will not be persisted in the Pulp server and will
not be present for future calls (unless specified again by the user).

The classes in this module are used to simplify these configuration options into
a single API. Methods are provided for accessing values across all of the
different configuration types as well as accessing an individual configuration
area.

    """
    Provides APIs for retrieving values used to drive how a plugin should
    function for a given call on a repository.

    The lifespan of these instances is scoped to an individual call; the plugin
    should not cache these instances. It is possible that these instances
    contain one-off overridden configuration values that are not meant to
    persist between invocations on the plugin.
