class Profiler(object):
    """
    Base class for Pulp consumer profilers. Profilers must subclass this class
    in order for Pulp to identify them during plugin discovery.  The primary
    role of a Profiler is to perform translation between Pulp's generic content
    model and consumer specific content.

    Profile Translation:
        TBD

    Unit Translation:

    One example of a unit translation is to expand a unit that references
    other units into specific install requests for the aggregated units. The
    example below describes how a request for an aggregate unit ("mypets")
    would be translated into install requests for each related pet. The
    install for the aggregate unit itself does not need to be included in the
    results.

    Requested Unit:

        {type_id:"PETS", unit_key:{"name":"mypets"}}

    Translated Install Requests:

        {type_id:"DOG", unit_key:{"name":"Rover"}}
        {type_id:"DOG", unit_key:{"name":"Cujo"}}
        {type_id:"CAT", unit_key:{"name":"Garfield"}}

    Another example is using a unit as a meta type for multiple versions
    of the unit. In this example, the "myapp" meta unit is used to refer to
    the unit regardless of the destination consumer's platform. The job of
    the profiler is to understand the consumer to which the request applies
    and choose the appropriate format for the actual install request.

    Requested Unit:

        {type_id:"APP", unit_key:{"name":"myapp"}}

    For a Linux Consumer:

        {type_id:"TAR", unit_key:{"name":"myapp.tar"}}

    For a Windows consumer:

        {type_id:"ZIP", unit_key:{"name":"myapp.zip"}}
