class DownloadEventListener(object):
    """
    Downloader event listener class for responding to download events.

    The individual methods are used as callbacks at certain points in batch and
    individual download life-cycles.

    Callers are generally expected to sub-class this class in order to implement
    event-based functionality.

    This class is used as a stub class in the event that no sub-classed event
    listener is provided to a download backend.
