    Static test server that server files from the local directory and

    wants served into a custom sub-directory under 'data/'. Then tests can
    reach the files by using the url:
    http://localhost:8088/data/<custom-sub-directory>/<file>

    This server is run in a thread over the local loopback and should be
    started and stopped on each test or test suite run.

    It's recommended that start be put in setUpClass and stop be put in
    tearDownClass to avoid the overhead of starting and stopping on each test
    run.
