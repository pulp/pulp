# Email options
#
# Settings that allow the system to send email. It is highly recommended that
# the system relay through a local MTA on the machine. Pulp does not retry in
# case of error, so it is important to have a real MTA available locally.

# If there is a need to test email sending, it is recommended to run this:
#   $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
# which will write each message to stdout.
#
# host: (str) host name of the MTA pulp should relay through
# port: (str) destination port to connect on
# from: (str) the "From" address of each email the system sends
# enabled: (bool) either "true" or "false", controls whether emails will be sent.
