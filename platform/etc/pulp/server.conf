# seeds: comma-separated list of hostname:port of database replica seed hosts
# operation_retries: number of retries on database operations to
#     perform before giving up and reporting an error

operation_retries: 2


# = Server =
#
# Controls general Pulp web server behavior.
#
# server_name: hostname the admin client and consumers should use when accessing
#     the server; if not specified, this is defaulted to the server's hostname
# default_login: default admin username of the Pulp server; this user will be
#     the first time the server is started

#     should be changed once the server is operational
# debugging_mode: boolean; toggles Pulp's debugging capabilities

[server]

# = Security =
#
# Controls aspects of the Pulp web server security.
#
# For production installations, it is recommended that a new CA certificate be
# generated for the signing of user and consumer certificates and configured
# using the following properties.
#
# cacert: full path to the CA certificate that will be used to sign consumer
#     and admin identification certificates; this must match the value of
#     SSLCACertificateFile in /etc/httpd/conf.d/pulp.conf
#
# cakey: path to the private key for the above CA certificate
#
# ssl_ca_certificate: full path to the CA certificate used to sign the Pulp
#     server's SSL certificate; consumers and CDS instances will use this to
#     verify the Pulp server's SSL certificate during the SSL handshake
#
# user_cert_expiration: number of days a user certificate is valid
#
# consumer_cert_expiration: number of days a consumer certificate is valid

#     default permissions as local users.
#
# filter: directive to set more restrictive LDAP filter to limit the LDAP
#     users who can authenticate to Pulp

# [ldap]
# enabled: true
# uri: ldap://localhost

#     defaults to "amq.topic", which is a default exchange that
#     is guaranteed to exist on the broker
#
# The format for the following timeouts is <start>:<duration>. The <start>
# timeout is the number of seconds to wait for the consumer to acknowledge and
# begin handling the request before indicating a timeout has occurred. The
# <duration> timeout is how long the consumer is allowed to act on the request
# before the server considers the entire request timed out.

# = Email =
#
# Settings that allow the system to send email. It is recommended that
# the system relay through a local MTA on the machine. Pulp does not retry in
# case of error, so it is important to have a real MTA available locally.
#
# If there is a need to test email sending, it is recommended to run this:
#   $ python -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
# which will write each message to stdout.
#

#
# port: destination port to connect on
#
# from: the "From" address of each email the system sends
#
# enabled: booleanl controls whether or not emails will be sent
